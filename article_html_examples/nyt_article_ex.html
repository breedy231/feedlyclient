        <p class="css-nnwssh evys1bk0">Representative Justin Amash of Michigan announced on Saturday that he would not
            pursue the Libertarian Party’s nomination for president, bringing an end to his extended flirtation with a
            third-party candidacy that could have introduced a new element of uncertainty into the race between
            President Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p>

            for the ballot in all 50 states during a pandemic that has brought much of the country’s public life to a
            halt. He added that it would be difficult to raise money in the middle of a severe economic downturn.</p>

        <p class="css-nnwssh evys1bk0">Mr. Amash, a 40-year-old conservative of Syrian-American descent, stirred anxiety
            across the political spectrum last month when he declared that he was formally joining the Libertarian Party
            <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/politics/justin-amash-president.html"
                title="">to consider a campaign</a> for its 2020 presidential nomination. Republicans feared that he
            could peel away votes from Mr. Trump on the right, while Democrats worried that he would attract
            disillusioned Republican voters who might otherwise embrace Mr. Biden as the only available alternative to
            Mr. Trump.</p>

        <p class="css-nnwssh evys1bk0">It has been decades since a candidate who is neither a Republican nor a Democrat
            has become a major competitor for the presidency, but minor candidates have repeatedly peeled away support
            from the two traditional parties in disruptive ways. Mr. Amash could well have played that kind of role,
            especially in <a class="css-1g7m0tk"

        <p class="css-nnwssh evys1bk0">A poll taken this month by Monmouth University suggested Mr. Amash could have
            started a presidential candidacy that made a small but not insignificant imprint on the campaign. In a
            two-way race between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, the poll showed Mr. Biden ahead by 9 percentage points. With
            Mr. Amash included, Mr. Biden led by a slightly smaller margin of 7 percentage points.</p>

        <p class="css-nnwssh evys1bk0">In the poll, about four in five voters said they had no opinion of Mr. Amash.</p>
        <p class="css-nnwssh evys1bk0">On Saturday, Mr. Amash acknowledged that “polarization is near an all-time high,”
            leaving even less room than usual for options outside the traditional party system.</p>

        <p class="css-nnwssh evys1bk0">Mr. Amash said he would remain supportive of the Libertarian Party, though his
            exit from the presidential contest left the group without any White House contenders of even modest
            political stature. The small-government group welcomed Mr. Amash with open arms in April, when he became the
            only member of Congress to have ever been a member of the party.</p>

        <p class="css-nnwssh evys1bk0">In the past few elections, the Libertarians have nominated former Republican
            officeholders for the presidency. In 2016, a ticket composed of two former Republican governors, Gary
            Johnson of New Mexico and Bill Weld of Massachusetts, collected about four and a half million votes — a bit
            more than 3 percent of the popular vote.</p>
