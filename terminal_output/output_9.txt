They sat in a circle at a house in the hills a few hours north of San Francisco — where wine country becomes weed country — to discuss the therapeutic potential of CBD, and how to get people to take it seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeveral studies in rodents and in cell cultures had\n<a title href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462008000300015&lng=en&tlng=en">\nsuggested\n</a>\nthat CBD, a nonintoxicating compound from the cannabis plant more formally known as cannabidiol, could protect the nervous system, modulate blood flow, slow the growth of cancer cells and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We were talking about, ‘What can we do with this?’ ” recalled Samantha Miller, who hosted the event at her split-level house, wedged between redwoods and a creek below. A headstrong biochemist, she had been growing marijuana since the age of 14 and had just quit a six-figure job to start her own cannabis testing lab\n<strong>\n.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSamantha Miller at her home in northern California.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA ragtag crew of activists, doctors, writers and marijuana farmers met to discuss the potential of CBD in 2011 at Samantha Miller’s home.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nAfter two years of tracking down high-CBD pot plants and building momentum, the group began to devise ways to persuade more farmers to grow strains with CBD — which had largely been bred out of American pot since it doesn’t get you high. In addition to convincing marijuana dispensaries to widely carry CBD, they wanted to educate the public about its promising benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the group of ten or so brainstormed, a balloon of vaporized pot was passed in one direction and a bong in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There was a strong sense that this was really going to be something, if when people use these strains they have any kind of experience like the mice did in the laboratories,” said Martin Lee, a writer who at the time had been finishing a book\n<a title href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Smoke_Signals.html?id=8XE-AAAAQBAJ">\nabout the social history of marijuana\n</a>\nfor Simon &amp; Schuster.\n</p>\n<p>\nNear him was Stacey Kerr, a physician with flowing silver hair who served as treasurer of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, as well as Wade Laughter, a soft-spoken man in glasses who had started cultivating pot for his glaucoma in the mid-90s. Mr. Laughter and Lawrence Ringo, an old-school hippie grower, were some of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC — the compound that does get you high. Both pledged to keep their strains available for other growers at cheap prices. (Mr. Ringo said he would sell his seeds for as little as $5.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, there was Fred Gardner, a writer who had recruited almost all of these people to the CBD cause. A Harvard-educated former antiwar activist, now 78, Mr. Gardner had been writing about CBD since the late 1990s for publications like Synapse,\n<a title href="https://synapse.library.ucsf.edu/?a=d&d=ucsf19990701-01.2.4&srpos=2&e=-------en--20--1--txt-fred+gardner+gw-----txIN--">\nthe U.C. San Francisco weekly\n</a>\n. For years, he’d been determined to connect the nascent CBD research he heard about at symposiums abroad with the medical marijuana movement in California. And with this group, finally, it seemed to be coming together.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller spent the months after this meeting leading hundreds of CBD seminars for farmers; Dr. Kerr began informal patient surveys to track how CBD made people feel; and as he finished his book, Mr. Lee often traveled around with Mr. Laughter and Mr. Ringo’s high-CBD plants and seeds, spreading the gospel at pot shops across the West.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was aware that this was a pretty special moment,” Dr. Kerr told me, talking about the night at Ms. Miller’s. “That it was the beginning of something big, and we were there to see it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAt the time of Samantha Miller’s summit in 2011\n</strong>\n, THC was the sole chemical “face” of the plant. Cannabis containing significant amounts of CBD was still rare. Police raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana businesses were still common. And because CBD doesn’t get you high, it was easy to miss; hardly anyone outside of pharmaceutical companies and academia had heard of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the nine years since that night in the woods, one of the group’s biggest goals has clearly been accomplished: People know about CBD.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/opinion/24lewis4/merlin_170651910_ce93e3a5-32dd-4c3c-8a14-3e9a5751f199-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nIt has been estimated that the U.S. CBD industry will be worth $16 billion by 2025.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nJennifer Aniston loves beauty products made with it.

And e-commerce sales of CBD\n<a title href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/cbd-e-commerce-sales-are-booming-with-the-world-battling-covid-19-2020-04-06-71975826?mod=mw_quote_news">\nhave grown\n</a>\nthis year amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the CBD landscape of 2020 looks nothing like what the activists and scientists intended. That’s because the federal government’s insistence that cannabis has no legitimate use as a medicine created two enormous problems: the proliferation of fake CBD products and the nonsensical separation of CBD from THC.\n</p>\n<p>\nClinical studies\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16209908">\nhave shown\n</a>\nthat CBD is most effective when paired with at least some THC, even if it is not enough to cause a high. However, the United States considers cannabis with THC to be a Schedule 1 drug — which puts it in the same category as heroin, indicating a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This makes further research very difficult to do, and causes sick people in many states to be treated as criminals.\n</p>\n<p>\nCannabis that is high in CBD but extremely low in THC was made legal at the end of 2018. But finding an easy, affordable test that is able to distinguish cannabis with THC from cannabis without THC has been prohibitively difficult\n<a title href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/02/21/hot-hemp-pits-states-against-feds">\nfor farmers\n</a>\nand\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/cbd-thc-cannabis-cannabidiol.html">\ncrime labs\n</a>\nalike. So federal agencies have been\n<a title href="https://hempindustrydaily.com/fda-cbd-regulation-delay-is-costing-profits-and-shelf-space/">\nslow to regulate\n</a>\nthe booming industry — leading to a deluge of tinctures, smoothies and lotions that trusted tests have shown contain no CBD at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the absence of oversight, the push to get more patients access to cannabis medicine — and bona fide CBD — has been co-opted by a push to make as much money as possible off the next big wellness fad. “At a certain point, it had a life of its own,” Ms. Miller told me.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, the CBD industry promises a miracle drug but is often selling a placebo: cannabidiol products with zero cannabidiol inside. As a result, the compound is often caricatured as snake oil, a scam, even as promising research into the full potential of CBD is starting to pick up.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe compound’s reputation is a microcosm of what it means to be in America right now: a thing that some of us consider a hoax and others praise as the solution to everything. But CBD’s rollicking journey from the international underground to cultural ubiquity proves that, as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAs marijuana use increased in the 1960s and ’70s\n</strong>\n, and the Nixon administration criminalized drugs to vilify what\n<a title href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">\none aide described\n</a>\nas “the antiwar left and black people,” the more science-minded side of the government began funding some basic cannabis research. A man named Carlton Turner helped establish the government’s Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi. After that, he became President Ronald Reagan’s drug czar, helping to\n<a title href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-10-26-8603200589-story.html">\nexpand the War on Drugs\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut all the while, Mr. Turner was in touch with a Brazilian scientist named Elisaldo Carlini who had done\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7028792">\nsmall-scale human studies\n</a>\nshowing CBD reduced seizures: “All the early work on CBD was Carlini in Brazil,” Mr. Turner told me this past summer. “We were in communication for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFor decades, Dr. Carlini’s research was not replicated, in part because so few people had access to the compound: Both the pot held at the nation’s sole government-sanctioned marijuana lab at the University of Mississippi and the illegal pot being smoked around the country had only trace CBD content. (Mr. Turner even tested several kinds of cannabis sent by a legendary pot grower, a writer for “High Times” named Mel Frank. To no avail: none of it contained much CBD.)\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nCarlton Turner helped establish the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nThe University of Mississippi\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nIn those years, emissaries of California’s counterculture were often traveling the world looking for unique strains of cannabis. The most influential of these collectors was a man named David Watson. In the early 70s, Mr. Watson sold his possessions and began hitchhiking from Morocco to India, befriending local pot growers along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Watson ultimately settled in Amsterdam to examine his thousands of kinds of cannabis at his own Dutch state-licensed company, HortaPharm BV. He brought in a friend, an American botanist named Robert Connell Clarke to help. When Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke heard about the CBD research Dr. Carlini had done in Brazil, the pair identified and then bred CBD varietals. This led to a discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It attenuates the high,” Mr. Clarke told me over breakfast in Los Angeles. “That came strictly from anecdotal stoner evidence.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA marijuana plant.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nRobert Connell Clarke was an influential collector of unique strains of cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, after multiple sclerosis patients in England became more vocal about how cannabis helped their symptoms, the country allowed a small pharmaceutical company led by a British physician named\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nDr. Geoffrey Guy\n</a>\nto develop plant-derived cannabis medicines; GW Pharmaceuticals\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nlicensed varietals\n</a>\nbred from Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke’s collection of cannabis and got to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Within a couple of years, they figured out a 1:1 combination of a high-THC chemovar and a high-CBD chemovar presented the greatest latitude of effects and prevention of side effects,” said Dr. Ethan Russo, who worked with GW Pharmaceuticals from 1998 to 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke had discovered, having CBD in the mix reduced THC’s more uncomfortable effects: sedation, inebriation, a faster heart rate. And though a few outliers responded well to CBD alone, GW’s data showed that for relieving pain and inflammation, helping with sleep and alleviating seizures and spasms, most patients got the most benefit from an equal mix of CBD and THC — a drug the company called\n<a title href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-feb-01-me-medpot1-story.html">\nSativex\n</a>\n. But the research wasn’t enough. Although the drug has been approved for use in around 30 countries, the F.D.A. has yet to approve Sativex in the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nMr. Gardner, the writer whose CBD advocacy\n</strong>\neventually inspired the 2011 summit\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA copy of O’Shaughnessy’s, the Journal of Cannabis in Clinical Practice, from 2011.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nFred Gardner in his home on March 2, 2020.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nEnter, three years later, one of Oakland’s pioneering pot entrepreneurs, a medical marijuana impresario with pigtail braids named Steve DeAngelo. Mr. DeAngelo, who had been in contact with Mr. Gardner about the urgent need to institute better testing, agreed to help fund a cannabis analysis lab, Steep Hill, which began its operations in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Gardner came by frequently, chatting and checking in to see if Steep Hill’s founders had discovered the elusive compound. And at last, in February 2009 a dual peak on a testing graph appeared, indicating the presence of CBD.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I remember the moment,” said David Lampach, one of the lab’s funders and co-founders. “Seeing the dual peak and realizing it was real, and running it like five times to make sure.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the summer of 2009, the lab had identified five strains with significant CBD and THC. Mr. Gardner was elated, and began referring to his efforts as “Project CBD” alongside other supporters, including Mr. Lee, the writer. “Right away the thought was: ‘What is the government going to say about this? How can they be against something that’s nonintoxicating?’ ” Mr. Lee said.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June of 2010, the host of the 2011 summit, the biochemist Ms. Miller, opened her own lab, Pure Analytics. A few months later, she called Mr. Ringo, the hippie grower, to let him know a pot sample he sent in was a strain with a lot of CBD — as much as 11 percent.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nContainers of a cannabis flower samples at the Steep Hill lab, which began operations in 2008.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA technician macerating cannabis flower samples at Pure Analytics.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n“He’s in the trim room on speaker, and this big whoop goes up,” she said, remembering his staff’s excitement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 2010, a\n<a title href="https://www.projectcbd.org/">\nProject CBD\n</a>\nwebsite was set up where anyone could look through studies organized by disease or condition. Mr. Lee took charge of running it and it began to attract an audience. A few months later, the network of early CBD advocates met up at Ms. Miller’s house in California to coordinate their evangelism. And by the middle of 2011, word of cannabidiol had permeated the population that would become its most potent promotional engine: the chronically ill, people with cancer, with ALS, with serious disorders that weren’t responding to prescription drugs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs stories about CBD’s power spread, demand increased and prices rose. Sick people often relied on the generosity of growers like Mr. Ringo, his son Dakota told me.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nLawrence Ringo in Blocksburg, Calif., about 2010. He was of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKathleen Hart\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n“I’d go up there and see people dying of cancer hanging out with him, and he’d be hooking them up with oil he made in his house,” the younger Mr. Ringo said. Mike Hyde, whose son was suffering from brain cancer, spent months driving around Colorado and the West Coast looking for CBD in late 2011, before connecting with Mr. Ringo at a restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d never met this guy before, and he brought us literally probably $30,000 worth of oil for this CBD that no one could even get,” Mr. Hyde explained. “For free.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCBD’s big launch into the mainstream came when the world saw evidence of what Dr. Carlini had discovered in Brazil, back in the 1970s: the compound’s ability to quell seizures. Unlike a reduction in pain, this was something any politician or camera crew could easily see. It wasn’t a stoner scam.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, in December 2011, an epileptic child used CBD on the Discovery Channel’s “Weed Wars,” a show featuring the co-founder of the Steep Hill lab, Mr. DeAngelo. The following year, the parents of an epileptic boy in San Francisco\n<a title href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/medical-marijuana-epilepsy/">\nbought\n</a>\nCBD from a pot shop. Then, looking for a better quality product, they contacted GW Pharmaceuticals — the British company that had licensed the cannabis collection of those globe-trotting 20th century cannabis collectors, Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke, and which conducted the research in the ’90s that spurred Mr. Gardner’s CBD advocacy. The\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\ncompany developed\n</a>\na 98 percent CBD drug for the boy and others like him.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteve DeAngelo, a pioneering pot entrepreneur.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\n‘Bubba D’ plants in the Clones &amp; Seeds section of Harborside, one of the first dispensary to laboratory test cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nPerhaps the most critical turning point for CBD came in August 2013, when a CNN special hosted by Dr. Sanjay Gupta profiled a 6-year-old girl in Colorado, Charlotte Figi, who used CBD to treat her epilepsy, as well as the brawny brothers who grew her CBD, the Stanleys. Hundreds of families — witnessing the power of CBD enhanced by cable news production values — moved to Colorado to gain access to the Stanleys’ CBD oil, called Charlotte’s Web. The Stanleys told me their wait-list peaked at 15,000 names. And because of public demand, the F.D.A. fast-tracked clinical trials of GW Pharmaceuticals’ 98 percent CBD drug, Epidiolex.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly, everyone wanted CBD, even though no one quite understood it. In the confusion, there was money to be made. Mere weeks after the CNN documentary aired, the spike in CBD interest prompted the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n<a title href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2013/finra-warns-investors-marijuana-stock-scams">\nto issue an investor alert\n</a>\non marijuana stock scams: As the F.D.A. would\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/warning-letters-and-test-results-cannabidiol-related-products">\nlater show\n</a>\n, many online CBD products contained little or no CBD whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIn 2020, CBD is available three ways:\n</strong>\nover the counter; at state-licensed marijuana dispensaries; or if you have certain forms of epilepsy, from GW Pharmaceuticals. Most Americans encounter CBD in the first and most unreliable way — at, say, a bodega in Brooklyn or a health food store in Indiana. A consultant hired to do an investigation by a corporate chain recently told me that the percentage of over-the-counter CBD products that contained the amount on the label was “in the single digits.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs if CBD’s back story couldn’t get any weirder, the path to this glut of phony CBD was paved by, of all people, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnrelated to the brouhaha on the West Coast, tobacco farmers in Kentucky were seeking a new cash crop. In 2011, James Comer won the race for Kentucky state agriculture commissioner by promising to legalize industrial hemp.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That raised a lot of eyebrows, including in McConnell’s office,” Eric Steenstra, a hemp lobbyist, told me. “They saw the winds were shifting.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlong with Representative Jared Polis, now the governor of Colorado, Mr. McConnell included a hemp pilot program in the 2014 farm bill — for “research.” In the legislation, hemp was defined as cannabis containing\n<a title href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/">\nless than 0.3 percent THC\n</a>\n— an arbitrary threshold, not a scientific distinction: Nothing in the Farm Bill, in case law, or in the Controlled Substances Act seemed to say anything about CBD. So entrepreneurs interpreted this research-oriented pilot program as the de facto legalization of cannabidiol.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration disagreed, but couldn’t stop the tidal wave of CBD production. In 2018,\n<a title href="https://www.kyagr.com/marketing/hemp-overview.html">\nover 60 percent\n</a>\nof the hemp crop in Kentucky was grown for CBD. Then, long after the country was already flooded with CBD products both dubious and legitimate, Mr. McConnell inserted language into the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly making hemp\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process">\nfederally legal\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany of the Californians who plotted at Ms. Miller’s house in 2011 have watched in frustration as the CBD industry flourished, divorced from THC, and fake CBD misled consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn his deathbed in 2014, Mr. Ringo insisted to friends and family that the Stanleys used his seeds to develop their famous strain Charlotte’s Web. Joel Stanley told me the genetics for Charlotte’s Web were a “cross of wild hemp with an industry genetic.” Critics of the Stanley brothers in the cannabis industry have grown annoyed by their prominence and push for patents. Their company has been valued at over half a billion dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller, who still runs a cannabis testing lab, told me that in the years since the 2011 summit, she has become disillusioned as people she’d thought had earnest intentions in spreading CBD turned out to just want to get rich. Mr. Gardner feels the same way.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteep Hill provides cannabis testing services to cultivators, processors, dispensaries, collectives and authorized medical cannabis patients.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nThere has been a slight uptick in clinical research around the compound’s relation to anxiety, schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. In September, the National Institutes of Health\n<a title href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-investigate-minor-cannabinoids-terpenes-potential-pain-relieving-properties">\napproved\n</a>\n$3 million in small grants for studies of cannabidiol and other non-THC cannabis compounds. Nevertheless, the government-enabled ham-handed rush to profiteering has seriously, and unduly, undermined CBD’s medical reputation.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven Dr. Turner, Mr. Reagan’s drug czar, said there is far more evidence for the benefits of Sativex, the half-CBD, half-THC drug, than for unregulated CBD online.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There haven’t been enough clinical trials and there never will be,” said Mr. Clarke, the cannabis seed collector. “There’s no vested financial interest in anyone doing it.” Big Pharma is most invested in medications that they can control, that they alone can patent.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill, some of the states with legal cannabis have implemented robust testing standards, and bona fide CBD can be found at many marijuana dispensaries, both on its own and in a variety of ratios with THC. Ms. Miller’s lab, and other responsible actors, are supposed to ensure products that hit legal pot shop shelves contain exactly what they claim to contain. But without stringent federal oversight, few in the CBD business will voluntarily opt-in to tests of their product labeling’s accuracy.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen I asked Dr. Russo, who oversaw much of GW Pharmaceuticals’ research, how he feels about it all, he sighed. “You do something, and other people run with it, and it turns into something else that you don’t recognize,” he said. “I’m always concerned, but what I like to dwell upon is: What is the real potential here?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Chicago Lewis (\n<a title href="https://twitter.com/msamandalewis">\n@msamandalewis\n</a>\n) is an investigative reporter, focusing on drug policy.

Poor parts of the Midlands and north of England would get lots of infrastructure investment, helping them to close the productivity gap with London. The country would be “levelled up”.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe idea always seemed a little far-fetched. British governments have been trying to boost productivity outside London for decades, with not much success. And it seems less and less likely that the government will be able to focus on grand new designs as opposed to hasty repair jobs. But something else might happen, to spare Mr Johnson’s blushes. Rather than levelling up, Britain could be about to level down, as London sags.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon was not always the great success it is now. After the second world war the government, which had already pinched the capital with a thick Green Belt, deliberately pushed businesses and citizens out to “new towns” in the Home Counties. Manufacturing declined, as did the docks that had once provided jobs and prosperity. By the 1980s the city’s population had fallen by a quarter from the 8.6m it had hit in 1939. London’s schools and services were famously awful.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the Big Bang deregulated financial services in 1986, the logic of agglomeration reasserted itself and London took off. The creative industries and, in recent years, a thriving tech centre have joined the staples of banking, asset management and business services. Schools, policing and transport have all been transformed. People have flooded in from all continents, making London the world’s most global city.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet some warning signs have been visible for a while. Although London’s population has continued to grow, over the last decade that has been driven by international migration and the birth rate. Between 2008 and 2018, 550,000 more Britons left London than moved to it. People complain of high costs and anxiety. One league table in which London scores poorly is the Office for National Statistics’ rankings of well-being and life satisfaction. Since 2015 migration from the capital has helped reduce the differential between London’s house prices and those in the rest of the country (see chart).\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img src="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200523_BRC642.png">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBut London’s house prices remain double those elsewhere. After housing costs are accounted for Londoners are, on average, worse off than residents of the rest of southern England or Scotland. The chairman of\n<small>\nPWC\n</small>\n, a professional-services firm, has argued that graduates are turning their backs on London. Whereas 60% of graduates working for the big four accounting firms used to be based in the capital, in 2018 60% of new starters were outside.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe London office-cost premium is even higher than the housing-cost one. Prime square footage in the capital costs three times as much as space in other southern cities and seven to nine times as much as elsewhere in Britain. According to a legal recruitment firm, a company can save about £20,000 ($24,500) a year by moving a lawyer out of central London, after office costs and salary are taken into account. “Northshoring”—usually referring, confusingly, to places such as Birmingham that are far from northerly—has become something of a buzzword in the industry.\n<small>\nHSBC\n</small>\nchose to move its British retail banking headquarters to Birmingham in 2017. Amazon, an internet retailer, picked Manchester for its major British corporate site in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the coronavirus crushes property values and office rents, London might become a little less offputting. Perhaps some graduates will be tempted back from Leeds or Manchester. But covid-19 and the extreme social-distancing measures used to combat it pose a new and more profound danger to the capital, for they threaten two factors that have been central to its success: fun and foreigners.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon’s triumph is at least partially based on it being a fun place to live. “People come here not only because you can get paid well but because you can have a good time,” says Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy. The bars and cafes of the East End have been an important driver of what Mr McWillams once dubbed the “flat white economy”, where people with interesting hair bounce ideas off each other while drinking trendy beverages.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt is hard to have a flat white economy when you have to maintain two-metre distancing while queuing for your caffeine. Restaurateurs fear that being forced to operate at a lower capacity will drive many of them out of business. Theatres are facing disaster. As a hedge-fund manager puts it, “London without the culture and the restaurants is just a more expensive Frankfurt with more congestion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCovid-19 might combine with Brexit to cut international migration. Although foreign candidates for London jobs will score better on Britain’s new points-based immigration system than those for jobs elsewhere in the country, because the jobs are better paid, the signal has been sent: Britain is not keen on mass immigration. Universities fear that foreign student numbers could fall by 20-50% in the year ahead. For London, with its more than 100,000 foreign students, that is a problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike all great cities, London could also suffer from changing assumptions about work. Many firms now expect that some people will keep working from home even after the danger of coronavirus has receded—if not every day then several days a week. As firms learn to make do with smaller offices, workers might prize bigger homes outside London where they can have an office. The trade-off between space and commuting time looks different if you only have to go in two or three times a week. But if this happens, it will probably benefit commuter towns in the south-east rather than the northern and Midlands towns that Mr Johnson wanted to help.\n</p>\n<p>\nLisa Taylor of Coherent Cities, a consultancy, remains optimistic. “The next two years are going to be very tough,” she argues.“But a different city could emerge on the other side. One where land use has changed, where we have more co-working and co-living spaces.” She reckons that a greener, less congested London could take its inspiration from cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But those are hardly world-beating metropolises.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon is unlikely to slip back into the dismal state it was in before the mid-1980s. It is likely to remain richer and more productive than the rest of Britain. It will remain Europe’s most powerful magnet for talented immigrants. Still, its pulling power is likely to wane. If that happens, Britain’s economy will probably suffer. But a less centralised country, in which opportunity was more evenly distributed, might be a better place in other ways.\n<span>\n■\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\nEditor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of\n</em>\nThe Economist Today\n<em>\n, our daily\n<a href="https://my.economist.com/user#newsletter">\nnewsletter\n</a>\n.

My goal was not just to build another bookmarking service, it was to make web browsing better by creating an alternative interface in the new tab screen.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere is two posts about this goal in this blog, feel free to check them out if you\'re interested;\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nTLDR;\n</strong>\nKozmos is a service that provides you a new tab extension that works completely offline, stores all your information in your web browser, and finally syncs them up with Kozmos\' servers, so you can access them anywhere.\n</p>\n<h2>\nThe Chrome Extension\n</h2>\n<p>\nKozmos\' Chrome extension only requires access to browser\'s tabbing API and also Kozmos\' own website. It does not inject anything to other websites. Its periodically syncs your bookmarks with its servers, without exchanging any other data. Furthermore, the\n<a href="https://github.com/kozmos/browser-extensions">\nwhole extension is open source\n</a>\n, including the library that\n<a href="https://github.com/kozmos/likedb">\nsyncs up your bookmarks to Kozmos\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBesides of this, people who install Kozmos are the people who pays for it. So, it\'s not spyware. I never sold the data. I wanted to get some funding to grow it, however, got a lot of rejections from investors, and some conditional offers weren\'t acceptable for me.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy wife has been using Kozmos actively since I built it. She was using it to organize pregnancy related videos and web pages 3 years ago, now she uses it to organize her programming bookmarks (\n<a href="https://github.com/novatogatorop">\nshe became programmer, too.\n</a>\n). There is also some people who has paid for it monthly.\n</p>\n<h2>\nThe Nightmare\n</h2>\n<p>\nGoogle\'s Chrome Extension team has been giving me a complete nightmare since last two years. They kept sending me robotic take-down notices although the extension was not violating any policies. I was able to deal with all these robotic take down notices by copy pasting my answers until a human being from Chrome extension team could see my answers, and realize that there was nothing wrong with Kozmos\' extension.\n</p>\n<p>\nEvery single e-mail thread started by a take down notice would go like this;\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nGoogle (Robot): We\'ll take your extension down\n</li>\n<li>\nMe: Hey, this must be a mistake\n</li>\n<li>\nGoogle (Robot): No mistake, review these policies, your extension violates one of them\n</li>\n<li>\nMe: It does not violate any of them, this is a mistake!\n</li>\n<li>\nGoogle (Finally human): Oh, sorry, a mistake.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nImagine having the same conversation, and starting it again the next week. Robots can afford it, as they are good at repeating, and I also dealt with it although it was stressful for me.\n</p>\n<p>\nNote that, Kozmos is not my full time job. Unfortunately, it never made it to there. And these e-mails became quite exhausting for me, and there was no way to stop them.\n</p>\n<h2>\nThe Final Touch\n</h2>\n<p>\nFinally, Google took Kozmos\' Chrome Extension down a few months ago. This time, there was no notice e-mail at all. It was taken down, and there was no clear reason behind it, no notice, nothing. Google, a company that violates privacy of millions of people, took my hard work down without any explanation. And when they did this, they could access all the e-mail threads of their team admitting that Kozmos\' extension did not violate any policy but their robots actually made poor conclusions.\n</p>\n<p>\nObviously, Google don\'t care about the policies they wrote. They want to take down, they can take down.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis was already my second time to publish Kozmos\' extension in the store, with second account that I created and paid for.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, either I\'d create the third account, deal with all these bullying executed by Google\'s idiotic algorithms until one day they take my extension down without any notice again, or I just shut Kozmos down.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe project I built alone by programming the every single line of it, the project I organized community events for and made tens of embarrassing pitches about, the project I spent days for shooting and editing videos to promote it... will be completely gone!\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd I appreciate to have such a milestone. Not winning anything but losing all together, and looking the things I won; friends, learnings and the experience.\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally.

She was supposed to be working on a scholarly book about her research, but started writing intensely erotic Batman fan fiction instead.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nIt happened almost by accident. It was 2012, and Ms. Cain — who grew up in Orange County, Calif., under a different name — was three years out of college, alone abroad with a lot of time on her hands. Her command of Japanese was halting, and English titles in bookstores were wildly expensive. So Ms. Cain started reading things she could find for free online, and soon discovered fanfic — stories by amateurs that borrow characters and plots from established pop-cultural franchises.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nMs. Cain began devouring works set in the world of Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” trilogy. She decided to write some of her own, featuring Batman’s nemesis Bane as a sexy antihero, and posted them for free online. She quickly developed a fan base, becoming something of a star in her sub-subgenre.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nA few years later, she was living in Arlington, Va., and working as a bartender when she began to wonder if she could turn her hobby into a business. Her husband and parents discouraged her from pursuing something so impractical. Agents were equally dismissive, rejecting or ignoring Ms. Cain’s queries for more than a year. Then, a fellow writer helped Ms. Cain send a manuscript to Blushing Books, a small publishing house in Charlottesville. An editor read it overnight and sent her a contract the next day.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nIn the spring of 2016, she published “Born to Be Bound,” an adaptation of her fanfic. The story takes place on a future earth where most of humanity has died from a plague and survivors live under a dome, divided into a wolfpack-like hierarchy of dominant Alphas, neutral Betas and submissive Omegas. A powerful, brutish Alpha named Shepherd takes an Omega woman named Claire captive, and they engage in rough, wolfish sex.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nMs. Cain’s fans posted nearly 100 positive reviews on Amazon, enough to get her some visibility. “Unapologetically raw and deliciously filthy,” read one glowing blurb. The debut was a hit. She rushed out several more titles, and the series grossed some $370,000, according to her publisher.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nFor the next two years, Ms. Cain published at breakneck speed, producing a novel every few months by repurposing her older fan fiction, keeping her books in the algorithmic sweet spot of Amazon’s new releases and turning herself into a recognizable brand. “Dip your toes into the erotica pool,” she said on a 2016 sci-fi and fantasy podcast. “There’s nothing to do here but make money.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nThen, in 2018, Ms. Cain heard about an up-and-coming fantasy writer with the pen name Zoey Ellis, who had published an erotic fantasy series with a premise that sounded awfully familiar. It featured an Alpha and Omega couple, and lots of lupine sex. The more Ms. Cain learned about “Myth of Omega” and its first installment, “Crave to Conquer,” the more outraged she became. In both books, Alpha men are overpowered by the scent of Omega heroines and take them hostage. In both books, the women try and fail to suppress their pheromones and give in to the urge to mate. In both books, the couples sniff, purr and growl; nest in den-like enclosures; neck-bite to leave “claim” marks; and experience something called “knotting,” involving a peculiar feature of the wolf phallus.\n</p>\n</div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/business/00Omegaverse-ellis-covers/merlin_172712673_b7ef78c0-82e8-49c3-8d1f-5d63854c687c-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nZoey Ellis began publishing her “Myth of Omega” series in early 2018. “You have to make sure you use the tropes of Omegaverse in order to be recognized by fans of the genre,” she said.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nQuill Ink Books\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div>\n<p>\nMs. Cain urged Blushing Books to do something. The publisher sent copyright violation notices to more than half a dozen online retailers, alleging that Ms. Ellis’s story was “a copy” with scenes that were “almost identical to Addison Cain’s book.” Most of the outlets, including Barnes &amp; Noble, iTunes, Apple and Google Play, removed Ms. Ellis’s work immediately. Ms. Cain’s readers flocked to her defense. “This is a rip off of Addison Cain,” one irate reader wrote on Goodreads. “So disappointed in this author and I hope Mrs. Cain seeks legal charges against you for stealing her work! Shame on you!”\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nIt’s hard to imagine that two writers could independently create such bizarrely specific fantasy scenarios. As it turns out, neither of them did. Both writers built their plots with common elements from a booming, fan-generated body of literature called the Omegaverse.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nThe dispute between Ms. Cain and Ms. Ellis is a kink-laden microcosm of tactics at play throughout the fanfic industry. As the genre commercializes, authors aggressively defend their livelihoods, sometimes using a 1998 law, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, to get online retailers to remove competitors’ books. When making a claim, a creator must have a “good faith belief” that her ownership of the work in question has been infringed.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nBut what does that mean when the ultimate source material is a crowdsourced collective? The question has members of the Omegaverse community choosing sides between Ms. Cain and Ms. Ellis — as will a federal judge in Virginia, who is considering whether the allegations, and the consequences, merit a payout of more than a million dollars.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>\nWelcome to the Omegaverse, where men can get pregnant\n</h2>\n<p>\nTo untangle the Omegaverse fight, it helps to understand its origins in a parallel literary universe — the vast, unruly, diverse, exuberant and often pornographic world of fan fiction.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nAfter getting its start decades ago in “Star Trek” zines, fanfic mushroomed when the internet made it easy for especially dedicated consumers of pop culture to find and create stories for one another. There are now subgenres upon subgenres, from “slash” (where two male characters pair up romantically, such as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson), to odder fare like “mundane AU” (an alternative universe where magical characters live in the real world — e.g., Harry Potter goes to a regular boarding school and has normal teen problems).\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhile some traditional authors have derided fan fiction writers as creative parasites, there isn’t really any way to stop them. Such works are legal as long as writers post them for free and don’t try to sell stories based on copyrighted material.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nBut too much money was at stake for the genre to remain amateur forever. E L James’s blockbuster series “Fifty Shades of Grey,” which sold\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/business/media/for-fifty-shades-of-grey-more-than-100-million-sold.html?_r=0">\nmore than 150 million copies\n</a>\n, started as fanfic based on Stephenie Meyer’s “Twilight” vampire saga. By swapping out copyrighted characters for nominally original ones — a practice known as “filing off the serial numbers” — fanfic writers like Ms. James, Christina Lauren and the cheekily named Tara Sue Me have leapfrogged into for-profit publishing.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nAs more fan fiction writers cross over into commercial publishing, turf wars have erupted. “Fan fiction made authors and publishers realize there was a thriving market for this stuff,” said Rebecca Tushnet, a copyright expert at Harvard Law School. “There’s much more of it, so there’s more opportunity for conflict.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nThe specific fanfic universe that spawned the Cain-Ellis dispute emerged about a decade ago, when devotees of the CW drama “\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/arts/television/secrets-to-the-long-life-of-supernatural.html">\nSupernatural\n</a>\n” began writing stories in which its two lead actors are lovers. One would be the dominant alpha male. The other man would be a feminized omega, often with the ability to become impregnated — a trope known as MPreg. Canine, and then lupine, sex stuff got mixed in.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nThe premise was wildly popular, and tropes were rapidly adopted by writers in other fandoms, including NBC’s “Hannibal” and MTV’s “Teen Wolf.” The sprawling body of work that followed came to be known as the Omegaverse, with its own rules, plot elements and terminology.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nSome Omegaverse stories involve lycanthropes (werewolves), vampires, shape-shifters, dragons, space pirates, others feature regular humans. But virtually all Omegaverse couples engage in wolflike behavior. Alphas “rut” and Omegas go through heat cycles, releasing pheromones that drive Alphas into a lusty frenzy. One particular physiological quirk that’s ubiquitous in Omegaverse stories, called knotting, comes from a real feature of wolves’ penises, which swell during intercourse, causing the mating pair to remain physically bound to increase the chance of insemination.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nThe appetite for such tales is large and growing. In the past decade, more than 70,000 stories set in the Omegaverse have been published on the fan fiction site Archive of Our Own. As it became more popular, the Omegaverse transcended individual fandoms and became an established genre on its own.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nWriters began publishing Omegaverse stories with original characters and settings, and authors started to publish them for profit. On Amazon, there are hundreds of novels for sale, including titles like “Pregnant Rock Star Omega,” “Wolf Spirit: A Reverse Harem Omegaverse Romance” and “Some Bunny to Love: An M/M MPreg Shifter Romance,” an improbable tale involving an Alpha male who can transform into a rabbit.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nThis was the thriving commercial backdrop to Ms. Cain’s allegation that Ms. Ellis stole her material. Ms. Ellis thought that the claim was absurd — and was prepared to say so in court.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>\nThe ‘cat mama’ strikes back\n</h2>\n<p>\nOne day last spring, Ms. Ellis met me for coffee at a hotel near Paddington Station. She doesn’t seem like someone who writes dark, edgy, sometimes violent erotica. She’s young, cheerful, and works in education in London, which is one of the reasons she declines to publish under her real name. Most days, she gets up at four in the morning to write, then heads to the school where she works. On her Amazon author page, she describes herself as a “cat mama” who loves “sexual tension that jumps off the page.”\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nMs. Ellis said she got into fan fiction in 2006. She read stories set in the Harry Potter universe at first, then moved on to other fandoms, including one for the BBC’s “Sherlock,” starring Benedict Cumberbatch, that introduced her to the Omegaverse. The genre was unlike anything else she’d encountered. She began dabbling in her own original writing, and in late 2017 began working on the “Myth of Omega” series.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nSet in a medieval fantasy world, the first novel, “Crave to Conquer,” features an Alpha emperor who becomes obsessed with a beguiling undercover Omega spy named Cailyn. She resists his advances, using magic to mask the scent of her pheromones, until she is overcome by the biological imperative. To appeal to other Omegaverse and dark romance fans, Ms. Ellis built the narrative around standard genre elements — the wolflike tics and mating, and an edgy dominant-submissive dynamic. (In fanfic terminology, some of the sexual scenarios would be labeled “dub-con,” or “dubious consent.”)\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\n“You have to make sure you use the tropes of Omegaverse in order to be recognized by fans of the genre,” Ms. Ellis said. “Crave to Conquer” and its sequel, “Crave to Capture,” were published in early 2018 by Quill Ink Books, a London company she founded. Readers gave the series glowing reviews on Goodreads and Amazon, calling it “sensational new Omegaverse!” and the “best Omega yet.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nIn late April 2018, Ms. Ellis got an email from a reader who had ordered one of her books from Barnes &amp; Noble, then learned that it wasn’t available anymore. She soon discovered that all of her Omegaverse books had disappeared from major stores, all because of a claim of copyright infringement from Ms. Cain and her publisher. Ms. Ellis found it bewildering.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\n“I couldn’t see how a story I had written using recognized tropes from a shared universe, to tell a story that was quite different than anything else out there commercially, could be targeted in that way,” Ms. Ellis said. “There are moments and scenarios that seem almost identical, but it’s a trope that can be found in hundreds of stories.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nA lawyer for Ms. Ellis and Quill filed counter-notices to websites that had removed her books. Some took weeks to restore the titles; others took months. There was no way to recover the lost sales. “As a new author, I was building momentum, and that momentum was lost,” Ms. Ellis said. And she worried that the “plagiarist” label would permanently mar her reputation.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nMs. Ellis decided to sue. “Everything would have been in question, my integrity would have been questioned, my ability to write and tell stories — all of that would have been under threat if I didn’t challenge these claims,” she said.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 2018, Quill Ink filed against Blushing Books and Ms. Cain in federal court in Oklahoma, where Ms. Ellis’s digital distributor is based, seeking $1.25 million in damages for defamation, interfering with Ms. Ellis’s career, and for filing false copyright infringement notices. In the suit, Quill’s lawyers argued that “no one owns the ‘omegaverse’ or the various tropes that define ‘omegaverse.’”\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nMs. Ellis’s lawyers thought they had a strong position. But they struggled to find a prior case that addressed whether fan fiction tropes could be protected by copyright.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\n“We were looking at cases to see if the courts had ever dealt with anything like this before, dealing with the emergence of this new literary genre,” said Gideon Lincecum, a lawyer who represents Quill Ink and Ms. Ellis. “We found there weren’t any.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nAddison Cain’s “Alpha’s Claim” series, blurbed as “unapologetically raw and deliciously filthy,” earned some $370,000.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nBlushing Books\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>\n‘Maliciously’ weaponizing the D.M.C.A.\n</h2>\n<p>\nThe intense rivalry isn’t limited to writers in the Omegaverse. As online publishing has gotten more competitive — there are millions of e-books available on Amazon, up from 600,000 in 2014 — some genre authors have grown aggressive in their efforts to dominate their literary niche.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nLast year, an author who writes in a popular romance subgenre called “Reverse Harem High School Bully Romance” — a trope in which a teenage female character has several aggressive male suitors — claimed that another author had copied her books, and demanded that she remove them. The accused author briefly removed her work from Amazon, but restored them after consulting a lawyer.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nOther authors have tried to use trademarks to go after their rivals. Writers have attempted to trademark generic phrases like “dragon slayer” and even the word “dark.” In 2018, the self-published romance author Faleena Hopkins caused a scandal after she registered a\n<a title href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/5/15/17339578/cockygate-explained-romance-publishing-faleena-hopkins">\ntrademark for the word “cocky,”\n</a>\nand sent infringement notices to other romance authors who used the word in their titles. Amazon temporarily removed some books, including “Her Cocky Firefighters” and “Her Cocky Doctors.” After suing several people unsuccessfully, Ms. Hopkins backed down.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nLike Cockygate, the Omegaverse case reveals how easily intellectual property law can be weaponized by authors seeking to take down their rivals. Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, individuals or companies can send takedown notices to retailers as long as they have a good faith belief that their work has been infringed. Retailers are protected from being named in related litigation if they remove the material, and many websites comply with D.M.C.A. notices without even investigating the claims. Legal experts say the system is easily abused.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\n“We’ve seen lots of examples of people sending D.M.C.A. notices when it’s pretty obvious that they didn’t think there was copyright infringement,” said Mitch Stoltz, a senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group. “There’s not much accountability.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nOn May 21, the U.S. Copyright Office\n<a title href="https://www.copyright.gov/policy/section512/">\nreleased a report\n</a>\ndetailing how the 22-year-old D.M.C.A. has failed to keep pace with the anarchic digital ecosystem, as online platforms have been overwhelmed by a crushing volume of takedown notices. Between 1998 and 2010, Google received fewer than three million such notices; in 2017, the company got more than 880 million — an increase of more than 29,000 percent, according to the report. Many requests are legitimate, but the report notes that other motives include “anti-competitive purposes, to harass a platform or consumer, or to try and chill speech that the rightsholder does not like.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nAmazon agrees that it’s a problem. As the rise of self-publishing has produced a flood of digital content, authors frequently use copyright notices to squash their competition. During a public hearing hosted by the U.S. Copyright Office in 2016, Stephen Worth, Amazon’s associate general counsel, said that fraudulent copyright complaints by authors accounted for “more than half of the takedown notices” the company receives. “We need to fix the problem of notices that are used improperly to attack others’ works maliciously,” he said.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nIn the Omegaverse case, Ms. Cain’s claim of copyright infringement against Ms. Ellis has struck some as especially tenuous. “They are not very original, either one of them,” said Kristina Busse, the author of “Framing Fan Fiction,” who has written academic essays about the Omegaverse and submitted expert witness testimony for the case on Ms. Ellis’s behalf. “They both stole from fandom or existing tropes in the wild.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nIntellectual property experts say copyright protection applies to the expression of ideas through particular phrasing, but doesn’t cover literary tropes and standard plot points. The writer of a crime novel, for example, can’t copyright the notion of a body discovered in the first act and the killer getting caught in the end.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nBut the Omegaverse case is likely the first time these legal arguments have been invoked in a dispute over works that grew out of a corpus of fan fiction generated informally by thousands of writers.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\n“In fan fiction, the sharing of tropes and story parts and plot lines is free flowing,” said Anne Jamison, a fanfic expert and associate professor of English at the University of Utah, who was skeptical of the notion that Omegaverse tropes could be copyrighted. “There’s a blurry line between what is specifically yours and what is somebody else’s.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nChad Graham\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>\n‘I don’t want her to make any more money’\n</h2>\n<p>\nMs. Ellis wasn’t the first Omegaverse figure Ms. Cain accused of plagiarism. In March 2016, she wrote a Facebook post charging that another author, who wrote under the name the Dragon’s Maiden, had copied at least 15 plot points from her novel “Born to Be Bred.” In a message to Ms. Cain, which Ms. Cain posted on Facebook, the Dragon’s Maiden denied she had stolen anything, and argued that “there are some similarities, but I honestly believe that they don’t go beyond common Lycan traits or actual wolf behavior.”\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nBut after being called a plagiarist in online comments, the Dragon’s Maiden, who lives in Wisconsin, removed her story from the internet. “Her fans came after me, even though our stories, other than being Omegaverse, were nothing alike,” she said in an interview.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nTwo years later, Ms. Cain and her publisher filed D.M.C.A. takedown requests against Ms. Ellis’s first two “Myth of Omega” books. Ms. Cain also asked her publisher to file an infringement notice against an Ellis novel that hadn’t even been released yet. “Book three needs to come down too. I don’t want her to make any more money off this series,” Ms. Cain wrote to Blushing Books in April, according to a court filing.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nShe also wanted to stop Ms. Ellis from publishing a new spinoff series of Omegaverse books, and emailed her publisher, asking what they could do. Bethany Burke, the publisher of Blushing Books, was skeptical: “The problem is — as you say — you do not own Omegaverse,” she wrote. “I don’t know what mechanism we can use to shut her down completely as an author, unless YOU want to try to trademark Omegaverse. (Which we might be able to get.)”\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nThat message, produced in discovery, probably won’t help Ms. Cain’s chances in court. She has not always been her own best advocate. In a deposition last year, Ms. Cain said that the overlap between her books and Ms. Ellis’s series went beyond the Omegaverse elements. “It has nothing to do with trope, it has nothing to do with Omegaverse, it has to do with plot similarities,” she said. But when she was asked to cite specific examples, she said she couldn’t recall any, adding that she hadn’t done a close comparison because it was too upsetting. “It was hard for me to read them side by side, honestly, because I felt very violated,” she said.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nStill, Ms. Cain is fighting the lawsuit. “The theft of my work was devastating,” she wrote in a\n<a title href="https://www.facebook.com/AddisonlCain/posts/2280620302264328/">\nFacebook message\n</a>\nto her followers last spring. “Unfortunately, I am now facing retaliation for doing what I am legally allowed to do, which is to try and prevent unauthorized uses of my works.” More than 70 fans left encouraging notes, punctuated by heart emojis and angry cat .gifs. “It is infuriating that she can drag you through this when she is the one who stole your work,” one wrote.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nMs. Cain, who now lives in Virginia with her husband and 2-year-old daughter, said through her lawyer over email that she disagrees with the claims brought against her, but declined to discuss specific allegations, citing ongoing litigation.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nThe biggest development in the case so far is that Blushing Books has left Ms. Cain to contest the matter alone. Last year, the publisher conceded that no plagiarism or copyright infringement had occurred, and a judgment was entered against the company, which paid undisclosed monetary damages to Quill and Ms. Ellis. (Ms. Cain is now self-publishing.)\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nMs. Ellis and her publishing company filed a new civil suit against Ms. Cain in her home state of Virginia, arguing that she maliciously directed her publisher to send false copyright infringement notices to retailers. Ms. Cain’s lawyers have denied the claims, and have lined up authors, bloggers and readers as witnesses.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nIf the judge, or a jury, finds Ms. Cain in the wrong, the case would send a message to overzealous genre writers that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act is not to be abused. By the same token, authors of genuinely original stories might find they have one fewer legal lever to protect their work. And a victory by Ms. Cain could encourage a free-for-all, emboldening authors to knock back competitors and formally assert their ownership of swaths of the fan fiction universe and common tropes in genre fiction.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nDiscovery is ongoing, and a pretrial conference before a judge is scheduled for June. In the meantime, the Omegaverse continues to thrive. This year, more than 200 new books from the genre have been published on Amazon.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nThe latest batch draws on virtually every genre and trope imaginable: paranormal shifter romances, paranormal Mpreg romances, reverse harem romances, sci-fi alien warrior romances. There are fantastical Alpha-Omega stories featuring witches, unicorns, dragons, vampires, wolf-shifters, bear-shifters, and wolf-shifters versus bear-shifters. There are comparatively pedestrian Omegaverse romances about celebrity chefs, dentists, frat boys, bakers, bodyguards and billionaires. In a teeming multiverse of stories, the tropes are still evolving, inexhaustible.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n<em>\nKitty Bennett and Susan Beachy contributed research.\n</em>\n</p>\n</section>\n<p>\nAdvertisement\n</p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/business/omegaverse-erotica-copyright.html#after-bottom">\nContinue reading the main story\n</a>\n</article>', 'direction': 'ltr'}, 'title': 'A Feud in Wolf-Kink Erotica Raises a Deep Legal Question', 'author': 'Alexandra Alter', 'summary': {'content': 'What do copyright and authorship mean in the crowdsourced realm known as the Omegaverse?', 'direction': 'ltr'}, 'alternate': [{'href': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/business/omegaverse-erotica-copyright.html', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'crawled': 1590230408862, 'published': 1590224425000, 'origin': {'streamId': 'feed/http://morss.it/rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml', 'title': 'NYT > Top Stories', 'htmlUrl': 'https://www.nytimes.com'}, 'visual': {'url': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/business/00omegaverse-04/00omegaverse-04-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'width': 600, 'height': 750, 'processor': 'feedly-nikon-v3.1', 'contentType': 'image/jpeg'}, 'canonicalUrl': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/business/omegaverse-erotica-copyright.html', 'unread': True, 'categories': [{'id': 'user/ede62ec0-5773-49b1-bfe7-c2843e0f4dec/category/News', 'label': 'News'}], 'engagement': 5652, 'engagementRate': 0.49}, {'id': 'Mv/ZSFaK2g3sMbevU8eA1gDKPxcWlGA0Z5zuJKoJ6pU=_1724101e74d:251098a:ff496e89', 'keywords': ['Politics'], 'originId': 'https://theintercept.com/?p=307559', 'recrawled': 1590246187159, 'updateCount': 1, 'fingerprint': '6aa5a6b7', 'thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2020/05/edit_GettyImages-961533360-440x440.jpg'}], 'content': {'content': '<p><u>“The Covid virus</u> has been a gift from God,” began Ken Eldred. “The kingdom of God advances through a series of glorious victories, cleverly disguised as disasters.”</p>\n<p>In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Eldred noted, millions of Americans are turning to Christ, Walmart is selling out of Bibles, and online church broadcasts have hit record numbers.</p>\n<p>But while religiosity was growing, there have been setbacks from the disease outbreak. “Satan has been busy too,” Eldred, a major donor to evangelical and Republican causes, explained. “The virus has messed up many of our plans involving our in-person meetings with voters.”</p>\n<p>And the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/vote-by-mail-wisconsin-pennsylvania-elections/">rise of mail-in ballots</a>, Eldred added, would undercut voter identification laws, which have been a pillar of GOP election strategy. “The children of the darkness put early voting into this CARES package,” he grumbled, a reference to the $400 million for election assistance programs to states included in the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill.</p>\n\n<p>Following a brief prayer led by Eldred,<span>\xa0in which he declared that “we have now turned the corner on the virus” and asked God for an end to coronavirus deaths,\xa0</span>the business of the call got started: How Christian voters can be a force to reelect Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>The call, held in mid-April, one in a series of meetings sponsored by United in Purpose, a low-key group that has quietly become a preeminent venue for leaders on the religious right to convene. UIP was crucial in connecting Trump to evangelical leaders in 2016, and it promises to be one of the most vital weapons in Trump’s reelection arsenal this year.</p>\n<p>At first, the effort may seem like a throwback. Participants in the group include televangelist preachers and anti-gay activists. David Barton, a historian that serves on the board of UIP, sells <a href="https://shop.wallbuilders.com/dvds">box sets</a> of DVDs arguing that America was founded as a fundamentalist Christian nation with no separation of church and state.</p>\n<p>But the group, whose supporters include major donors to conservative causes, pastors, and political operatives with decades of winning elections, is serious about serving as the tip of the spear to maintain control of the White House. UIP’s 2020 election plan — which it calls “Ziklag,” a town referenced in the Bible — is a multipronged effort to connect Trump with evangelical leaders and increase support among minority voters through appeals to faith-based messages and church outreach.</p>\n<p>UIP did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p><div data-promo="the-coronavirus-crisis" data-crop="promo"></div>\n<p>And, perhaps most importantly, it plans to use data mining to identify millions of new voters and target them with cheap ads on Facebook. The pandemic, speakers noted on the call, means that they must work overtime to compensate for the effects of mail-in voting.</p>\n<p>The unprecedented campaign would mobilize what they call “dormant evangelical and conservative Catholic voters,” with a focus on appealing to religious affiliation as a way to compensate for Trump’s relative lack of support among nonwhite voters. They expect to focus on reducing Democratic support among African Americans and older, religiously active Latino voters in particular, as they <a href="https://hiddentribes.us/">tend</a> to hold <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/02/27/5-facts-about-black-democrats/">far more</a> culturally conservative, devout religious views than white liberals.</p>\n<p><u>UIP,</u> though not a well known group, has emerged in recent years as the essential conduit connecting the religious right to the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>“While few Americans know about United in Purpose,” noted Katherine Stewart, the author of “The Power Worshippers,” a new book on the Christian nationalist movement and its takeover of the Republican Party, “the organization has claimed to know at least something about all or most American voters.”</p>\n<p>The group works closely with the Family Research Council, the arch-conservative family values think tank led by Tony Perkins. The board includes former Rep. Bob McEwen, R-Ohio, an active member of the religious right through his role in convening the Council for National Policy, another Christian conservative group.</p>\n<p>Tax disclosures show that UIP received $75,000 from the Wellspring Committee, the same <a href="https://maplight.org/story/secretive-conservative-legal-group-funded-by-17-million-mystery-donor-before-kavanaugh-fight/">mysterious nonprofit</a> that financed the television advertising campaign to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Another major donor to UIP is Maj. Gen. Vernon B. Lewis Jr., who retired from the military to found MPRI, a defense contractor sold to L-3 Communications, and another defense consulting firm called Cypress International.</p>\n<p>In June 2016, after Trump effectively secured the nomination, UIP <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/06/21/483018976/inside-trumps-closed-door-meeting-held-to-reassures-the-evangelicals">hosted</a> a high-profile meeting between then-candidate Trump and about a thousand evangelical leaders. Trump reportedly used the event to promise an array of social conservative agenda items, including lifting political restrictions on churches and a promise to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/05/11/federalist-society-judges-ethics-rule/">appoint judges in line with religious right priorities</a>.</p>\n<p><div data-campaign="" data-subhead data-headline="" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-cta="" data-layout=""></div>\n<p>Since Trump’s election, UIP has hosted regular meetings across the country to convene prominent religious leaders and donors. In 2017, UIP hosted an awards gala at the Trump International Hotel hosted by <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/04/ginni-thomas-trump-conservative-group/">Ginni Thomas</a>, the spouse of Justice Clarence Thomas. The following year, Vice President Mike Pence <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/morning-report/419576-the-hills-morning-report">attended</a> a UIP dinner.</p>\n<p>Last September, members flocked to the Luxe Sunset Boulevard, a trendy Los Angeles hotel, to discuss strategy and hear from singer Pat Boone, who discussed how faith issues are influencing Hollywood. George Seay, a major GOP donor and chief executive of Annandale Capital, a global investment firm, has hosted Ziklag events for members of UIP.</p>\n<p>UIP plans to replicate the 2016 campaign event, which was high-profile enough to generate headlines around evangelical <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/trumps-play-to-win-evangelical-voters/488075/">support</a> for Trump. But this year, the focus will be on minority outreach. During the call, UIP’s Brian Burch said that the group hopes to host an event for Trump to meet and pledge support to African American and Latino church leaders.</p>\n<p>Burch added that UIP has already “made a series of grants to partners focused in key states” to begin efforts to reach minority faith-based voters.</p>\n<p>Ralph Reed, a major figure in evangelical outreach for President George W. Bush, addressed the April call to provide what he called a “macro political picture” of the election ahead. In rapid succession Reed explained previous election results, comparing Trump to Mitt Romney to argue that lower turnout among African Americans in battleground Rust Belt states had been key to GOP success.</p>\n<p>“There were 47,000 fewer black votes cast in 2016 compared to 2012 in just Milwaukee County alone,” said Reed. “In Michigan, similar outcome, Trump wins by 10,704 votes out of about 2 million cast in Michigan. And there were 36,000 fewer votes cast by African Americans in Detroit, Wayne County.”</p>\n<p>“They are convinced that Hillary [Clinton] lost because she failed to replicate [Barack] Obama’s turnout of minority voters,” Reed added. “And they are focused on that like a laser beam as Trump is on evangelicals and pro-life Catholics.”</p>\n<div>\n<a href="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2020/05/edit_GettyImages-961533360.jpg"><img alt="Marjorie Dannenfelser, President of Susan B.

Anthony List, an anti-abortion advocacy group active in GOP elections, recently joined UIP as an ally for outreach. The group, though less well known as its pro-reproductive rights counterpart Planned Parenthood, is a major player in congressional elections. SBA List, which includes a super PAC, announced its intention to spend <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/trump-gets-2020-boost-from-anti-abortion-rights-group-susan-b-anthony-list.html">$52 million</a> on the 2020 cycle in January.</p>\n<p>During the April call, Dannenfelser emphasized the need to adapt tactics to meet the unique circumstances of the pandemic. Voters will need powerful messages to urge them to vote by mail. And across independent and Democratic voters, the abortion issue cuts across partisan lines, especially in Rust Belt states, she claimed.</p>\n<p>“The battle for the, for the working-class pro-life voter in those battleground states is going to be key,” Dannenfelser said. SBA List, she added, has been conducting survey research on exactly how to message abortion issues. “And what we’re finding, not surprisingly, but it’s good to know, is that the born alive issue that the president has raised the profile of, has had a tremendous affect in moving persuadable voters in all of those areas in Republicans, Democrats, and Independents.”</p>\n<p>This plan appears to dovetail with the Trump campaign’s own strategy. In January, Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-to-court-latinos-in-miami-as-part-of-launch-of-evangelical-group/2020/01/03/db2e85b8-2dc1-11ea-be79-83e793dbcaef_story.html">launched</a> “Evangelicals for Trump” at King Jesus International Ministry, a largely Latino megachurch in Miami led by Pastor Guillermo Maldonado, a prominent evangelical leader.</p>\n<p>“My administration will never stop fighting for Americans of faith,” Trump declared at the event. “We will restore the faith as the true foundation of American life.”</p>\n<p><u>But the bulk</u> of UIP’s 2020 efforts, Reed explained on the call, is grounded in the identification of new religious voters. To reach nontraditional faith-based voters, UIP is using an array of data-mining tools.</p>\n<p>Reed claimed his “data partners” had identified 26 million key voters in battleground states, about three-fourths of whom are Facebook users. “We can reach them,” said Reed, “and it’s pennies on the dollar in terms of targeting a message compared to what the other side is going to spend on television.”</p>\n<p>While the call didn’t specify exactly what these tools are, several members of UIP have been involved in creating technological tools for voter ID.</p>\n<p>UIP was founded by Bill Dallas, a former model, San Francisco real estate investor, and technology entrepreneur, who became a born-again Christian while serving a prison sentence for embezzlement. One of the first businesses Dallas founded after leaving San Quentin State Prison was the Church Communication Network, a satellite and online network to broadcast church programming.</p>\n<p>Dallas now runs Pioneer Solutions, a data-mining operation used to find and activate religious voters. In 2015, an information technology researcher stumbled upon a trove of demographic information on voters affiliated with Pioneer Solutions, including information on gun ownership and whether or not an individual had a “Bible lifestyle.” The inadvertent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/03/bill-dallas-christian-nationalist-right-donald-trump">data leak</a> featured information covering 191 million U.S. citizens. “We have about 200 million files, so we have pretty much the whole voting population in our database,” <a href="https://www1.cbn.com/thebrodyfile/archive/2016/09/15/brody-file-exclusive-evangelical-leader-says-its-still-to-be-determined-whether-evangelicals-will-show-up-strongly-in-november">boasted</a> Dallas in an interview with Christian Broadcasting Network the following year.</p>\n<p>Brian Burch, the official with UIP who helped\xa0lead the April call, serves as president of the group CatholicVote, a group that <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/news/parish/pro-trump-group-targets-catholic-voters-using-cell-phone-technology">collects</a> potential voter information by harvesting vast troves of cellphone location data.</p>\n<p>The controversial strategy allowed CatholicVote to use what is known as a “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/political-campaigns-track-cellphones-to-identify-and-target-individual-voters-11570718889">geofence</a>” to target voters with frequent Catholic church attendance.

The groups, using names such as “Blacks for Trump,” “Evangelicals for Biblical Immigration,” “Veterans for Trump,” and “Nurses and Doctors for America,” were routinely filled with misinformation and hate.</p>\n<p>A post shared across the Kullberg network of Facebook groups <a href="http://archive.fo/sZq1G#selection-2393.76-2393.112">warned</a> that refugee programs represented “cultural destruction and subjugation.” Another <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/05/15/radical-evangelical-facebook/">claimed</a> Muslims are incapable of assimilation because a “normal Muslim’s loyalty is to Sharia law and supremacy.”</p>\n<p>In a separate UIP conference call in May 2019, Kullberg discussed the need to find messages to inspire conservative voters after conferring with Reid Rutherford, a solar energy executive who has donated to the group. The pair reviewed survey research data to prepare a dossier for the 2020 election.</p>\n<p>“Those issues include the sanctity of life versus infanticide,” Kullberg said. “What are the images that most move people? The content that drives those talking points,” she added, noting that she could push these election messages to her social media network.</p>\n<p>Kullberg suggested driving a wedge between lesbians and the transgender community by bringing attention to the fact that trans students would gain access to women’s bathrooms and women’s scholarships. “We’ll be pointing this out,” Kullberg said. “When we were involved with exposing the anti-Semitism of Linda Sarsour, that divided the Women’s March. There are some very smart moves to weaken or soften the opposition by telling the truth.”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes our side doesn’t really do that very well. We’re too worried about being nice,” Kullberg said. “But then we end up with infanticide. So we just realized we need to play to win this time. This is a hill worth charging.”</p>\n<p>Kullberg claimed she could reach 80 million people with her Facebook network during the call. But her network was later shut down after it was exposed in a <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190609/upper-arlington-woman-linked-to-deceptive-facebook-network">report</a> by the fact-checking website Snopes.</p>\n<p><u>Meanwhile,</u>\xa0the novel coronavirus threatens to undermine their efforts and draw attention away from these conservative wedge issues.</p>\n<p>George Barna, a pollster, has worked closely with UIP to shape its approach. In a recent memo to the group, he warned that the coronavirus pandemic has sharply reshaped American priorities going into the election, with a new focus on health care, unemployment, economic growth, and stability.</p>\n<p>On abortion, Barna warned, “one might have expected the issue to have decreased in importance in the eyes of moderates and liberals,” while in fact, “it was conservatives who were relatively more likely to indicate a decline in importance for that issue.”</p>\n<p>Still, UIP could serve as a potent force in the election.</p>\n<p>“All major political operations—of all parties—now rely on big data and activist networks to sharpen their effectiveness in election campaigns,” observed Katherine Stewart, who wrote about evangelical political operations in “The Power Worshippers.”</p>\n<p>“A key difference, however, is that United in Purpose’s voter turnout machine is at the top of a long pyramid that largely operates in the religious sphere, almost all of which is exempt from taxes and shielded from public scrutiny.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2020/05/23/coronavirus-evangelical-megachurch-trump/">Inside the Influential Evangelical Group Mobilizing to Reelect Trump</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>', 'direction': 'ltr'}, 'title': 'Inside the Influential Evangelical Group Mobilizing to Reelect Trump', 'author': 'Lee Fang', 'summary': {'content': '<p>United in Purpose held a call in April detailing its 2020 strategy to reelect Trump, including targeting minorities and using data-mining tools.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2020/05/23/coronavirus-evangelical-megachurch-trump/">Inside the Influential Evangelical Group Mobilizing to Reelect Trump</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>', 'direction': 'ltr'}, 'enclosure': [{'href': 'https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2020/05/edit_GettyImages-1193819617-e1590096632397.jpg', 'width': 1400, 'height': 700}, {'href': 'https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2020/05/edit_GettyImages-961533360.jpg'}, {'href': 'https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2020/05/edit_GettyImages-1192031828.jpg'}], 'alternate': [{'href': 'https://theintercept.com/2020/05/23/coronavirus-evangelical-megachurch-trump/', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'crawled': 1590228543309, 'published': 1590228033000, 'origin': {'streamId': 'feed/https://theintercept.com/feed/?rss', 'title': 'The Intercept', 'htmlUrl': 'https://theintercept.com'}, 'visual': {'url': 'https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2020/05/edit_GettyImages-961533360-1024x682.jpg', 'width': 1024, 'height': 682, 'processor': 'feedly-nikon-v3.1', 'contentType': 'image/jpeg'}, 'unread': True, 'categories': [{'id': 'user/ede62ec0-5773-49b1-bfe7-c2843e0f4dec/category/News', 'label': 'News'}], 'engagement': 25310, 'engagementRate': 4.93}, {'id': '48QEacI6ziVKaPGiKezXffOp++W1DgSiluc7D/ghVIs=_17240c2d760:24c2cde:ff496e89', 'originId': 'https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/05/22/boarded/', 'fingerprint': 'ea6e438f', 'content': {'content': "<div>\n<h2>\nJust some red flags. No big deal. Just ignore them.\n</h2>\n<p>\nOnboarding at a new company can be a weird thing. Besides the very corporate-sounding name itself (that makes some of us think\n&quot;waterboarding&quot;), there are some odd ways they try to &quot;teach&quot; the new employees.\n</p>\n<p>\nHere's a situation: you're in a conference room with about a dozen other new people. You're handed a touch bar Macbook Pro in a backpack. It's the first such model you've ever used, and you're discovering that your natural typing position overhangs the top row of numbers, and is triggering the &quot;meta&quot; functions which typically live there: brightness up/down, volume up/down, and whatever else might be there from the context of the program you're in.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlso, the keyboard is the infamous &quot;butterfly&quot; one, and this is your first time on one of them. You've heard about it but this is your first tango with this particular thing. It turns out to not be very nice. You're making lots of mistakes, despite having decades of typing experience at relatively high speeds. You start feeling very old.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey have you do a bunch of random crap to get signed in to things. They have a half-assed &quot;single sign on&quot; system that really isn't, and there are a bunch of vendors which require their own authorization stuff. You have to install a bunch of apps on your (personal!) phone to do the two-factor auth and other security stuff: there's Duo, then the Google app, and then Lastpass. You also get to sign in to all of this stuff on the laptop itself, making typing errors galore along the way, and triggering things on the touch bar.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnyway, at some point, you get this going, and now it's time to start &quot;installing&quot; the dev environment. You run a bunch of arcane commands, including something where you &quot;curl&quot; something from a provided URL, and pipe it into a shell, thus letting it do whatever it wants to do. There is not a proper installer per se.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis starts downloading multiple gigabytes of data. You and the other dozen-or-so people are all doing this at the same time, in the same enclosed space, on the same wireless network. Most of you are sitting in the middle of the room and thus are not next to a wall with power outlets. Your laptop heats up, and the fan ramps up. The battery starts ticking down.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen they ask you to minimize that, because it's time for the next thing. Let it finish in the background, they said. It has to run for a long time and this way we can move on to the next stage.\n</p>\n<p>\nYes, someone's here to try to teach the group how to use the internal systems. Everyone is to go out to this survey company's web site and type in a password they've written on the marker board. You know those surveys where companies ask if you liked their service at your last transaction? It's that kind of thing.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou're supposed to go dive into the internal tooling to look at the directory of employees. You're supposed to find your manager's name and type it in, followed by their title. Then you're supposed to find out the name of the person who has a specific title somewhere else in the company.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou HAVE to type it in correctly. Until you do, it won't let you click [next]. They tell you not to click back or reload or anything like that, since &quot;you may screw it up&quot;.\n</p>\n<p>\nDid I mention there's a timer ticking down during all of this? It starts at maybe 2 minutes and it's just there, going 1:59, 1:58, 1:57, 1:56, ... and so on the whole time.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is basically the perfect environment for creating stress and general hatred of terrible systems. One of the questions was &quot;name a dog&quot;, because, well, the company directory included pets. I couldn't find one quickly. You were supposed to just click around the org chart until you found one.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, when I run into a thing like this, I start getting snarky and bitchy and start thinking laterally. Like, okay, watch me not use your stupid system but get the answer anyway. Case in point: there had been a dog in the room the day before. I just called out to the room: &quot;Hey, what was the name of the dog that was in here before? Sensor? Morsel? Six letters?&quot; ... and the answer came back: &quot;Nugget&quot;. I typed it in and it worked. &quot;Thanks!&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\nIt went on like this, asking more idiotic questions and sending me on wild goose chases through their stupid tools. Finally, it said &quot;stop here until the next part&quot; and noted that I had done only 30% of it so far. Yes, there was much more to go, plus who knows how many other modules were going to be executed this way. GROAN.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnother part had you pair up with someone else. You both had laptops, but one was purposely ignored for this, so you had to hand the one back and forth (or slide it on the table, whatever). Your failings were now someone else's problem. More stress and hatred of a terrible process.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt gets better, too: they had claimed (and lied) that &quot;your manager will be able to see the results of this&quot;. First of all, I doubt that was true. Second, my manager wouldn't give a rat's ass what the results of it would be. Third, I've been doing this long enough that I don't care\n<em>\neven if\n</em>\nthey could find out that I hate their terrible &quot;intranet&quot; tools and moronic timed treasure hunt for dog names and people's titles and did poorly at it.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey say stuff like that to scare the junior folks. It's bullshit. I know it and treat it as such, but they don't, and probably worry. Seeing it happen told me that they treat everyone like children, even their brand new software people. Bad sign.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter another hour of this, I had enough. I told my table-mate (the one with the other laptop) &quot;well, see you around&quot;. He asked if I was &quot;done for the day&quot; and I just said &quot;yep&quot;. Then I got up and quietly exited. I never went back to any of the water^H^H^H^H^Honboarding classes. It turned out to not matter.\n</p>\n<p>\nI was pretty bummed, and got on the train to go home.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe next day, I went in and just avoided the onboarding area. I should mention that nobody had requested or set up a desk for me, so I wound up camped like a refugee in some common space that was set up like a restaurant booth. Some friends who had already been at the company reached out and provided their own take on how to get started, and I went from that. I got my footing and started doing mildly useful things as a self-driven starter project.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf not for them reaching out and helping me, I probably would have just called it done right there and walked. Instead, they supported me. Of course, that just meant I got to stick around for the rest of the insanity that was my 2019, and wound up leaving anyway a year later.\n</p>\n<p>\n...\n</p>\n<p>\nEpilogue: while sitting there sans desk one day, by total chance, my manager walked by, spotted me for the first time since I had started, and asked if I was going to &quot;the fireside chat&quot; with some new incoming upper management type. I had no idea it even was a thing, but he said I should go, and so up I went with him.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe were a little early and people were standing around. I wound up being introduced to someone and I said hello. He found out it was now my third day at the company and he asked &quot;do you have a desk yet&quot;, and I said I did not. It was funny, right, being asked that with my new boss right there. But hey, honest questions get honest answers, and that's what he got.\n</p>\n<p>\nI later found out the person asking the question was the CEO. Awesome.\nMaybe he meant it as a joke, but I was dead serious: I had no desk.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs for why I didn't recognize the CEO: I had just started, and it's not like I memorize names and faces of these people. Hello, stalker-ville or ass-kisser-ville, and I am neither. I'll learn them as I need to learn them, and indeed, in due time, picked up the names and faces as it came up.\n</p>\n<p>\n...\n</p>\n<p>\nIn retrospect, there were many red flags. Well, pink flags.

Now, you can use your Triplebyte credentials on and off the platform. Just like LinkedIn, your profile will be publicly accessible with a dedicated URL that you can share anywhere (job applications, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc). When you do well on a Triplebyte assessment, your profile will showcase that achievement (we won’t show your scores publicly). Unlike LinkedIn, we aim to become your digital engineering skills resume — a credential based on actual skills, not pedigree.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe new profiles will be launching publicly in 1 week. This is a great opportunity to update your profile with your latest experience and preferences. You can edit your profile privacy settings to not appear in public search engines at any time.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur mission is to build an open, valuable, and skills-based credential for all engineers.

But instead, she blamed the unflattering beige curtains behind her, then spun her phone around to show off the vintage cane furniture with green frond upholstery in her favorite room at the prime minister’s residence.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n“This is a fabulous chair,” said Ms. Ardern,\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/opinion/sunday/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-prime-minister.html">\na global progressive icon\n</a>\n, plopping down after the brief tour. “And this is a much better corner, because where I was sitting before was right next to the nappy bucket, which I’m going to admit was not the freshest place to be sitting.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“So,” she continued after a deep breath, “when it comes to health services, you’ll see those starting to wind back up.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nPandemics are often described as crises of communication, when leaders must persuade entire populations to suspend their lives because of an invisible threat. Watching Ms. Ardern on Facebook, her favored conduit, is a lesson in rhetorical blending: epidemiology brightened with empathy, law leavened with mom jokes. And it has been strikingly effective.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nMs. Ardern helped coax New Zealanders — “our team of five million,” she says — to buy into a lockdown so severe that even retrieving a lost cricket ball from a neighbor’s yard was banned. Now the country, despite some early struggles with contact tracing, has very nearly stamped out the virus, exiting isolation with just 21 deaths and a few dozen active cases.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nBut at a time when Ms. Ardern, 39, is being celebrated in some quarters as\n<a title href="https://www.ft.com/content/d26564b4-80ba-11ea-82f6-150830b3b99a">\na saint\n</a>\n— when even a comedian imitating her\n<a title href="https://www.bbc.com/news/video_and_audio/headlines/52285061/jacinda-ardern-impressionist-i-m-trying-to-be-her-because-she-s-cool">\nsays\n</a>\nshe’s so nice that “to make fun of Jacinda almost feels like making fun of a puppy” — a lot gets missed.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nHalos can make heretics out of legitimate critics, including epidemiologists who argue that New Zealand’s lockdown went too far, that other countries suppressed the virus with less harm to small businesses.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nAnd Ms. Ardern’s canonization diminishes two powerful forces behind her success: Her own hard work at making connections with constituents, and the political culture of New Zealand, which in the 1990s overhauled how it votes, forging a system that forces political parties to work together.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\n“You need the whole context, the way the political system has evolved,” said Helen Clark, a former prime minister who hired Ms. Ardern as an adviser more than a decade ago. “It’s not easily transferable.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/21/world/00virus-ardern-2/merlin_172471248_f4608767-1c08-47f4-b8c2-c7650df260f2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nMs. Ardern with Finance Minister Grant Robertson at Parliament last week, after many of New Zealand’s lockdown measures were eased.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nPool photo by Rosa Woods\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>\nThe Perfect Democracy?\n</h2>\n<p>\nMs. Ardern, who declined to be interviewed for this article, is the product of a particular time and place: She grew up in a rural nation of lonely struggle, where demands were growing for a more responsive brand of politics.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nIn 1965, New Zealand was the world’s sixth-wealthiest country per capita, but by 1980, when Ms. Ardern was born, it had slipped to 19th. And that was before free-market reforms led to major job losses in manufacturing, public service and farming.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nMs. Ardern, the daughter of a police officer and a cafeteria worker who were Mormon, has often recalled seeing forestry jobs disappear in the small town where she grew up, leaving behind suicides, poverty and illness — including a case of hepatitis for her babysitter.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nAlongside the country’s economic frustration, the electoral system seemed to have broken down. Several elections produced results widely seen as unfair, with the popular vote going to one party and the majority of legislative seats to the other.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt all reached a breaking point in 1992, when unemployment\n<a title href="http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/snapshots-of-nz/nz-progress-indicators/home/economic/unemployment-rate.aspx">\npeaked at 10.7 percent\n</a>\nand a national referendum asked New Zealanders if they wanted to remake how the country conducted elections.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I protect myself while flying?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf air travel is unavoidable,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html">\nthere are some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n</a>\nMost important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus.

The city has met four of the seven metrics.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nIt still needs to have at least 30 percent of its hospital beds and intensive-care beds available. As of Friday morning, it had 27 percent of hospital beds and 26 percent of I.C.U. beds available.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nMr. de Blasio has pegged the city’s path to reopening on three different but related metrics: the number of new hospital admissions for illness resembling Covid-19, the number of patients in critical care and the percentage of positive coronavirus tests.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nMr. de Blasio said Friday that the city would not reopen until it saw a 10-to-14-day period with under 200 daily hospitalizations, fewer than 375 patients in intensive care in public hospitals, and a positive-test rate under 15 percent.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nThe number of those intensive-care patients was still well above the threshold, at 451, Mr. de Blasio said, but the city was meeting the other two criteria.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nBoth city and state officials have said that their metrics were likely to go hand in hand, and that they would coordinate their decisions on reopening. But on Friday, Mr. Cuomo suggested that the state’s guidelines took precedence.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n“It’s not up to the local officials,” Mr. Cuomo said of reopening. “It’s a statewide decision across the board.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Cuomo also announced 109 new virus-related deaths in the state, marking a fifth straight day that fatalities were just above 100.\n</p>\n<h2>\nAntiviolence workers’ new job: convince people to socially distance.\n</h2>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nWorkers for Street Corner Resources, an antiviolence group, handing out masks and gloves to people in Harlem.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nDesiree Rios for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen Iesha Sekou began passing out surgical masks and disposable gloves in Harlem early in the pandemic, some people laughed and said she was taking things too far.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I protect myself while flying?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf air travel is unavoidable,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html">\nthere are some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n</a>\nMost important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html">\nnew concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms\n</a>\n. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I get tested?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nthe C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears.\n</a>\nThey will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I help?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=7779">\nCharity Navigator\n</a>\n, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak.

Among them was a recommendation that religious officials defer to the directive of state and local governments.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nStill, the president threatened to “override” the governors if they did not follow his order, though it was not immediately clear what powers he was claiming. “I call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now,” he said. “If there’s any question, they’re going to have to call me, but they’re not going to be successful in that call.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nWhen the C.D.C. recently released a set of guidelines for reopening, its report largely mirrored an earlier\n<a title href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6935-CDC-opening-guidelines/e1a8802d0d76b3eb43a8/optimized/full.pdf#page=1">\ndraft version\n</a>\nthat the White House had rejected because Trump administration officials worried that the suggestions infringed on religious rights.\n</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>\nOn Friday the C.D.C.’s new guidelines for religious communities suggested that they consider a number of limitations to keep congregations safe. Among them:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n“Take steps to limit the size of gatherings in accordance with the guidance and directives of state and local authorities.”\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n“Consider suspending or at least decreasing use of a choir/musical ensembles and congregant singing, chanting, or reciting during services or other programming, if appropriate within the faith tradition. The act of singing may contribute to transmission of Covid-19, possibly through emission of aerosols.”\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n“Consider temporarily limiting the sharing of frequently touched objects that cannot be easily cleaned between persons, such as worship aids, prayer rugs, prayer books, hymnals, religious texts and other bulletins, books, shared cups, or other items received, passed or shared among congregants.”\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nMr. Trump said Friday at the White House that the nation needs religion. “In America, we need more prayer, not less,” he said. He left without taking questions.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nDavid Postman, the chief of staff for Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, said the state didn’t know what the president’s comments meant and noted the state had not seen any formal order. “We don’t believe the president has the ability to dictate what states can and cannot open,” Mr. Postman said.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nRhode Island’s governor, Gina Raimondo, was more blunt when told of the president’s comments, saying, “\n<a title href="https://turnto10.com/news/local/raimondo-sticks-to-may-30-reopening-of-churches-as-trump-deems-them-essential">\nNo, that’s not happening in Rhode Island\n</a>\n.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“We’re not ready,” she said. “Honestly, that would be reckless. It’s Friday. They’re not ready.”\n</p>\n<h2>\nStates differ on their approaches to religious services during the pandemic.\n</h2>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nChurches like the Basilica of San Albino in Mesilla, N.M., have resorted to measures like distributing communion to parishioners in cars during the pandemic.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nPaul Ratje/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div>\n<p>\nIt was not clear what authority President Trump was invoking on Friday when he called for governors “to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now,” and threatened to “override” them if they did not. Soon after he spoke, though, the C.D.C. issued guidelines urging faith leaders to “take steps to limit the size of gatherings in accordance with the guidance and directives of state and local authorities.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nStates and localities have been taking a variety of approaches to religious services since the outbreak began.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nHouses of worship were already allowed to operate in more than half of the states\n<strong>\n,\n</strong>\nthough many remain under social distancing instructions and many individual churches, synagogues and mosques have decided to remain closed for safety.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nThere have been tensions in places that still have restrictions in place. In California, more than 1,200 pastors signed a declaration protesting the state’s restrictions on in-person services and pledged to reopen their churches by May 31 even if the restrictions are not lifted. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said Friday that the state was working with faith leaders on guidelines to reopen in “a safe and responsible manner” that would be released by Monday at the latest.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nThe state’s guidelines, which will distinguish between megachurches and smaller venues, deal with the configuration of pews and “sanitation protocols,” the governor said.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Illinois, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said on Friday that he would “continue to operate on the basis of science and data” in deciding when it was safe for houses of worship to open.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\n“I’m as anxious as anybody to make sure that our churches, our mosques, our synagogues open back to where they were before Covid-19 came along,” Mr. Pritzker said. “We’re gradually moving in that direction. But there’s no doubt the most important thing is, we do not want parishioners to get ill because their faith leaders bring them together.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nThe president’s call to let in-person services resume came just before one of the biggest Muslim holidays of the year, Eid al-Fitr, which starts Saturday night.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWashington State currently allows drive-in services, where congregants remain in their vehicles, and allows houses of worship to bring in personnel to broadcast and stream videos of services. Officials there have been working with an interfaith group to develop guidelines on how religious institutions can safely open up for more in-person activities.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nAnd in some states, houses of worships were never required to close. In Pennsylvania, religious institutions were exempt from a stay-at-home order, though Gov. Tom Wolf has advised religious leaders not to hold in-person services or large gatherings to protect people from the virus.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nGov.

Many churches, synagogues and mosques there decided to remain closed anyway, and those that are reopening often remain under strict guidelines, including limiting the number of congregants who could enter.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nIn hard-hit New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo moved this week to allow religious gatherings of up to 10 people to resume as long as attendees wear masks and maintain social distance. The announcement was particularly significant for Jewish congregations, where a minyan, defined as 10 people over 13, is required for a worship service.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h2>\nBirx expresses concerns about case levels in Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington.\n</h2>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA view of Venice Beach, Calif., on May 17.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nRyan Young for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div>\n<p>\nOne testing measure shows that coronavirus cases are persisting at worrisome rates in three major metropolitan areas — Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C. — that are still under stay-at-home orders, a top White House official said on Friday.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\n“We have concerns of where cities have remained closed and metros that have remained closed but have still persistent high number of cases,” Dr. Deborah L.

If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too.

They sat in a circle at a house in the hills a few hours north of San Francisco — where wine country becomes weed country — to discuss the therapeutic potential of CBD, and how to get people to take it seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeveral studies in rodents and in cell cultures had\n<a title href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462008000300015&lng=en&tlng=en">\nsuggested\n</a>\nthat CBD, a nonintoxicating compound from the cannabis plant more formally known as cannabidiol, could protect the nervous system, modulate blood flow, slow the growth of cancer cells and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We were talking about, ‘What can we do with this?’ ” recalled Samantha Miller, who hosted the event at her split-level house, wedged between redwoods and a creek below. A headstrong biochemist, she had been growing marijuana since the age of 14 and had just quit a six-figure job to start her own cannabis testing lab\n<strong>\n.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSamantha Miller at her home in northern California.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA ragtag crew of activists, doctors, writers and marijuana farmers met to discuss the potential of CBD in 2011 at Samantha Miller’s home.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nAfter two years of tracking down high-CBD pot plants and building momentum, the group began to devise ways to persuade more farmers to grow strains with CBD — which had largely been bred out of American pot since it doesn’t get you high. In addition to convincing marijuana dispensaries to widely carry CBD, they wanted to educate the public about its promising benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the group of ten or so brainstormed, a balloon of vaporized pot was passed in one direction and a bong in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There was a strong sense that this was really going to be something, if when people use these strains they have any kind of experience like the mice did in the laboratories,” said Martin Lee, a writer who at the time had been finishing a book\n<a title href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Smoke_Signals.html?id=8XE-AAAAQBAJ">\nabout the social history of marijuana\n</a>\nfor Simon &amp; Schuster.\n</p>\n<p>\nNear him was Stacey Kerr, a physician with flowing silver hair who served as treasurer of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, as well as Wade Laughter, a soft-spoken man in glasses who had started cultivating pot for his glaucoma in the mid-90s. Mr. Laughter and Lawrence Ringo, an old-school hippie grower, were some of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC — the compound that does get you high. Both pledged to keep their strains available for other growers at cheap prices. (Mr. Ringo said he would sell his seeds for as little as $5.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, there was Fred Gardner, a writer who had recruited almost all of these people to the CBD cause. A Harvard-educated former antiwar activist, now 78, Mr. Gardner had been writing about CBD since the late 1990s for publications like Synapse,\n<a title href="https://synapse.library.ucsf.edu/?a=d&d=ucsf19990701-01.2.4&srpos=2&e=-------en--20--1--txt-fred+gardner+gw-----txIN--">\nthe U.C. San Francisco weekly\n</a>\n. For years, he’d been determined to connect the nascent CBD research he heard about at symposiums abroad with the medical marijuana movement in California. And with this group, finally, it seemed to be coming together.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller spent the months after this meeting leading hundreds of CBD seminars for farmers; Dr. Kerr began informal patient surveys to track how CBD made people feel; and as he finished his book, Mr. Lee often traveled around with Mr. Laughter and Mr. Ringo’s high-CBD plants and seeds, spreading the gospel at pot shops across the West.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was aware that this was a pretty special moment,” Dr. Kerr told me, talking about the night at Ms. Miller’s. “That it was the beginning of something big, and we were there to see it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAt the time of Samantha Miller’s summit in 2011\n</strong>\n, THC was the sole chemical “face” of the plant. Cannabis containing significant amounts of CBD was still rare. Police raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana businesses were still common. And because CBD doesn’t get you high, it was easy to miss; hardly anyone outside of pharmaceutical companies and academia had heard of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the nine years since that night in the woods, one of the group’s biggest goals has clearly been accomplished: People know about CBD.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/opinion/24lewis4/merlin_170651910_ce93e3a5-32dd-4c3c-8a14-3e9a5751f199-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nIt has been estimated that the U.S. CBD industry will be worth $16 billion by 2025.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nJennifer Aniston loves beauty products made with it.

That’s because the federal government’s insistence that cannabis has no legitimate use as a medicine created two enormous problems: the proliferation of fake CBD products and the nonsensical separation of CBD from THC.\n</p>\n<p>\nClinical studies\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16209908">\nhave shown\n</a>\nthat CBD is most effective when paired with at least some THC, even if it is not enough to cause a high. However, the United States considers cannabis with THC to be a Schedule 1 drug — which puts it in the same category as heroin, indicating a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This makes further research very difficult to do, and causes sick people in many states to be treated as criminals.\n</p>\n<p>\nCannabis that is high in CBD but extremely low in THC was made legal at the end of 2018. But finding an easy, affordable test that is able to distinguish cannabis with THC from cannabis without THC has been prohibitively difficult\n<a title href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/02/21/hot-hemp-pits-states-against-feds">\nfor farmers\n</a>\nand\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/cbd-thc-cannabis-cannabidiol.html">\ncrime labs\n</a>\nalike. So federal agencies have been\n<a title href="https://hempindustrydaily.com/fda-cbd-regulation-delay-is-costing-profits-and-shelf-space/">\nslow to regulate\n</a>\nthe booming industry — leading to a deluge of tinctures, smoothies and lotions that trusted tests have shown contain no CBD at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the absence of oversight, the push to get more patients access to cannabis medicine — and bona fide CBD — has been co-opted by a push to make as much money as possible off the next big wellness fad. “At a certain point, it had a life of its own,” Ms. Miller told me.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, the CBD industry promises a miracle drug but is often selling a placebo: cannabidiol products with zero cannabidiol inside. As a result, the compound is often caricatured as snake oil, a scam, even as promising research into the full potential of CBD is starting to pick up.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe compound’s reputation is a microcosm of what it means to be in America right now: a thing that some of us consider a hoax and others praise as the solution to everything. But CBD’s rollicking journey from the international underground to cultural ubiquity proves that, as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAs marijuana use increased in the 1960s and ’70s\n</strong>\n, and the Nixon administration criminalized drugs to vilify what\n<a title href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">\none aide described\n</a>\nas “the antiwar left and black people,” the more science-minded side of the government began funding some basic cannabis research. A man named Carlton Turner helped establish the government’s Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi. After that, he became President Ronald Reagan’s drug czar, helping to\n<a title href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-10-26-8603200589-story.html">\nexpand the War on Drugs\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut all the while, Mr. Turner was in touch with a Brazilian scientist named Elisaldo Carlini who had done\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7028792">\nsmall-scale human studies\n</a>\nshowing CBD reduced seizures: “All the early work on CBD was Carlini in Brazil,” Mr. Turner told me this past summer. “We were in communication for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFor decades, Dr. Carlini’s research was not replicated, in part because so few people had access to the compound: Both the pot held at the nation’s sole government-sanctioned marijuana lab at the University of Mississippi and the illegal pot being smoked around the country had only trace CBD content. (Mr. Turner even tested several kinds of cannabis sent by a legendary pot grower, a writer for “High Times” named Mel Frank. To no avail: none of it contained much CBD.)\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nCarlton Turner helped establish the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nThe University of Mississippi\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nIn those years, emissaries of California’s counterculture were often traveling the world looking for unique strains of cannabis. The most influential of these collectors was a man named David Watson. In the early 70s, Mr. Watson sold his possessions and began hitchhiking from Morocco to India, befriending local pot growers along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Watson ultimately settled in Amsterdam to examine his thousands of kinds of cannabis at his own Dutch state-licensed company, HortaPharm BV. He brought in a friend, an American botanist named Robert Connell Clarke to help. When Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke heard about the CBD research Dr. Carlini had done in Brazil, the pair identified and then bred CBD varietals. This led to a discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It attenuates the high,” Mr. Clarke told me over breakfast in Los Angeles. “That came strictly from anecdotal stoner evidence.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA marijuana plant.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nRobert Connell Clarke was an influential collector of unique strains of cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, after multiple sclerosis patients in England became more vocal about how cannabis helped their symptoms, the country allowed a small pharmaceutical company led by a British physician named\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nDr. Geoffrey Guy\n</a>\nto develop plant-derived cannabis medicines; GW Pharmaceuticals\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nlicensed varietals\n</a>\nbred from Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke’s collection of cannabis and got to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Within a couple of years, they figured out a 1:1 combination of a high-THC chemovar and a high-CBD chemovar presented the greatest latitude of effects and prevention of side effects,” said Dr. Ethan Russo, who worked with GW Pharmaceuticals from 1998 to 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke had discovered, having CBD in the mix reduced THC’s more uncomfortable effects: sedation, inebriation, a faster heart rate. And though a few outliers responded well to CBD alone, GW’s data showed that for relieving pain and inflammation, helping with sleep and alleviating seizures and spasms, most patients got the most benefit from an equal mix of CBD and THC — a drug the company called\n<a title href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-feb-01-me-medpot1-story.html">\nSativex\n</a>\n. But the research wasn’t enough. Although the drug has been approved for use in around 30 countries, the F.D.A. has yet to approve Sativex in the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nMr. Gardner, the writer whose CBD advocacy\n</strong>\neventually inspired the 2011 summit\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA copy of O’Shaughnessy’s, the Journal of Cannabis in Clinical Practice, from 2011.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nFred Gardner in his home on March 2, 2020.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nEnter, three years later, one of Oakland’s pioneering pot entrepreneurs, a medical marijuana impresario with pigtail braids named Steve DeAngelo. Mr. DeAngelo, who had been in contact with Mr. Gardner about the urgent need to institute better testing, agreed to help fund a cannabis analysis lab, Steep Hill, which began its operations in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Gardner came by frequently, chatting and checking in to see if Steep Hill’s founders had discovered the elusive compound. And at last, in February 2009 a dual peak on a testing graph appeared, indicating the presence of CBD.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I remember the moment,” said David Lampach, one of the lab’s funders and co-founders. “Seeing the dual peak and realizing it was real, and running it like five times to make sure.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the summer of 2009, the lab had identified five strains with significant CBD and THC. Mr. Gardner was elated, and began referring to his efforts as “Project CBD” alongside other supporters, including Mr. Lee, the writer. “Right away the thought was: ‘What is the government going to say about this? How can they be against something that’s nonintoxicating?’ ” Mr. Lee said.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June of 2010, the host of the 2011 summit, the biochemist Ms. Miller, opened her own lab, Pure Analytics. A few months later, she called Mr. Ringo, the hippie grower, to let him know a pot sample he sent in was a strain with a lot of CBD — as much as 11 percent.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nContainers of a cannabis flower samples at the Steep Hill lab, which began operations in 2008.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA technician macerating cannabis flower samples at Pure Analytics.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n“He’s in the trim room on speaker, and this big whoop goes up,” she said, remembering his staff’s excitement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 2010, a\n<a title href="https://www.projectcbd.org/">\nProject CBD\n</a>\nwebsite was set up where anyone could look through studies organized by disease or condition. Mr. Lee took charge of running it and it began to attract an audience. A few months later, the network of early CBD advocates met up at Ms. Miller’s house in California to coordinate their evangelism. And by the middle of 2011, word of cannabidiol had permeated the population that would become its most potent promotional engine: the chronically ill, people with cancer, with ALS, with serious disorders that weren’t responding to prescription drugs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs stories about CBD’s power spread, demand increased and prices rose. Sick people often relied on the generosity of growers like Mr. Ringo, his son Dakota told me.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nLawrence Ringo in Blocksburg, Calif., about 2010. He was of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKathleen Hart\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n“I’d go up there and see people dying of cancer hanging out with him, and he’d be hooking them up with oil he made in his house,” the younger Mr. Ringo said. Mike Hyde, whose son was suffering from brain cancer, spent months driving around Colorado and the West Coast looking for CBD in late 2011, before connecting with Mr. Ringo at a restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d never met this guy before, and he brought us literally probably $30,000 worth of oil for this CBD that no one could even get,” Mr. Hyde explained. “For free.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCBD’s big launch into the mainstream came when the world saw evidence of what Dr. Carlini had discovered in Brazil, back in the 1970s: the compound’s ability to quell seizures. Unlike a reduction in pain, this was something any politician or camera crew could easily see. It wasn’t a stoner scam.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, in December 2011, an epileptic child used CBD on the Discovery Channel’s “Weed Wars,” a show featuring the co-founder of the Steep Hill lab, Mr. DeAngelo. The following year, the parents of an epileptic boy in San Francisco\n<a title href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/medical-marijuana-epilepsy/">\nbought\n</a>\nCBD from a pot shop. Then, looking for a better quality product, they contacted GW Pharmaceuticals — the British company that had licensed the cannabis collection of those globe-trotting 20th century cannabis collectors, Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke, and which conducted the research in the ’90s that spurred Mr. Gardner’s CBD advocacy. The\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\ncompany developed\n</a>\na 98 percent CBD drug for the boy and others like him.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteve DeAngelo, a pioneering pot entrepreneur.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\n‘Bubba D’ plants in the Clones &amp; Seeds section of Harborside, one of the first dispensary to laboratory test cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nPerhaps the most critical turning point for CBD came in August 2013, when a CNN special hosted by Dr. Sanjay Gupta profiled a 6-year-old girl in Colorado, Charlotte Figi, who used CBD to treat her epilepsy, as well as the brawny brothers who grew her CBD, the Stanleys. Hundreds of families — witnessing the power of CBD enhanced by cable news production values — moved to Colorado to gain access to the Stanleys’ CBD oil, called Charlotte’s Web. The Stanleys told me their wait-list peaked at 15,000 names. And because of public demand, the F.D.A. fast-tracked clinical trials of GW Pharmaceuticals’ 98 percent CBD drug, Epidiolex.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly, everyone wanted CBD, even though no one quite understood it. In the confusion, there was money to be made. Mere weeks after the CNN documentary aired, the spike in CBD interest prompted the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n<a title href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2013/finra-warns-investors-marijuana-stock-scams">\nto issue an investor alert\n</a>\non marijuana stock scams: As the F.D.A. would\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/warning-letters-and-test-results-cannabidiol-related-products">\nlater show\n</a>\n, many online CBD products contained little or no CBD whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIn 2020, CBD is available three ways:\n</strong>\nover the counter; at state-licensed marijuana dispensaries; or if you have certain forms of epilepsy, from GW Pharmaceuticals. Most Americans encounter CBD in the first and most unreliable way — at, say, a bodega in Brooklyn or a health food store in Indiana. A consultant hired to do an investigation by a corporate chain recently told me that the percentage of over-the-counter CBD products that contained the amount on the label was “in the single digits.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs if CBD’s back story couldn’t get any weirder, the path to this glut of phony CBD was paved by, of all people, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnrelated to the brouhaha on the West Coast, tobacco farmers in Kentucky were seeking a new cash crop. In 2011, James Comer won the race for Kentucky state agriculture commissioner by promising to legalize industrial hemp.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That raised a lot of eyebrows, including in McConnell’s office,” Eric Steenstra, a hemp lobbyist, told me. “They saw the winds were shifting.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlong with Representative Jared Polis, now the governor of Colorado, Mr. McConnell included a hemp pilot program in the 2014 farm bill — for “research.” In the legislation, hemp was defined as cannabis containing\n<a title href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/">\nless than 0.3 percent THC\n</a>\n— an arbitrary threshold, not a scientific distinction: Nothing in the Farm Bill, in case law, or in the Controlled Substances Act seemed to say anything about CBD. So entrepreneurs interpreted this research-oriented pilot program as the de facto legalization of cannabidiol.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration disagreed, but couldn’t stop the tidal wave of CBD production. In 2018,\n<a title href="https://www.kyagr.com/marketing/hemp-overview.html">\nover 60 percent\n</a>\nof the hemp crop in Kentucky was grown for CBD. Then, long after the country was already flooded with CBD products both dubious and legitimate, Mr. McConnell inserted language into the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly making hemp\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process">\nfederally legal\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany of the Californians who plotted at Ms. Miller’s house in 2011 have watched in frustration as the CBD industry flourished, divorced from THC, and fake CBD misled consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn his deathbed in 2014, Mr. Ringo insisted to friends and family that the Stanleys used his seeds to develop their famous strain Charlotte’s Web. Joel Stanley told me the genetics for Charlotte’s Web were a “cross of wild hemp with an industry genetic.” Critics of the Stanley brothers in the cannabis industry have grown annoyed by their prominence and push for patents. Their company has been valued at over half a billion dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller, who still runs a cannabis testing lab, told me that in the years since the 2011 summit, she has become disillusioned as people she’d thought had earnest intentions in spreading CBD turned out to just want to get rich. Mr. Gardner feels the same way.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteep Hill provides cannabis testing services to cultivators, processors, dispensaries, collectives and authorized medical cannabis patients.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nThere has been a slight uptick in clinical research around the compound’s relation to anxiety, schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. In September, the National Institutes of Health\n<a title href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-investigate-minor-cannabinoids-terpenes-potential-pain-relieving-properties">\napproved\n</a>\n$3 million in small grants for studies of cannabidiol and other non-THC cannabis compounds. Nevertheless, the government-enabled ham-handed rush to profiteering has seriously, and unduly, undermined CBD’s medical reputation.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven Dr. Turner, Mr. Reagan’s drug czar, said there is far more evidence for the benefits of Sativex, the half-CBD, half-THC drug, than for unregulated CBD online.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There haven’t been enough clinical trials and there never will be,” said Mr. Clarke, the cannabis seed collector. “There’s no vested financial interest in anyone doing it.” Big Pharma is most invested in medications that they can control, that they alone can patent.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill, some of the states with legal cannabis have implemented robust testing standards, and bona fide CBD can be found at many marijuana dispensaries, both on its own and in a variety of ratios with THC. Ms. Miller’s lab, and other responsible actors, are supposed to ensure products that hit legal pot shop shelves contain exactly what they claim to contain. But without stringent federal oversight, few in the CBD business will voluntarily opt-in to tests of their product labeling’s accuracy.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen I asked Dr. Russo, who oversaw much of GW Pharmaceuticals’ research, how he feels about it all, he sighed. “You do something, and other people run with it, and it turns into something else that you don’t recognize,” he said. “I’m always concerned, but what I like to dwell upon is: What is the real potential here?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Chicago Lewis (\n<a title href="https://twitter.com/msamandalewis">\n@msamandalewis\n</a>\n) is an investigative reporter, focusing on drug policy.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I protect myself while flying?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf air travel is unavoidable,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html">\nthere are some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n</a>\nMost important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html">\nnew concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms\n</a>\n. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I get tested?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nthe C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears.\n</a>\nThey will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I help?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=7779">\nCharity Navigator\n</a>\n, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I protect myself while flying?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf air travel is unavoidable,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html">\nthere are some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n</a>\nMost important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html">\nnew concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms\n</a>\n. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor.

We believe that it is critical to move quickly and define such a standard, thereby freeing up researchers to innovate and diversify at the level of higher level algorithms and graph analytics applications. This effort was inspired by the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) of dense Linear Algebra, and hence our working name for this standard is “the GraphBLAS”.\n</p>\n<p>\nA key insight behind this work is that when a graph is represented by a sparse incidence or adjacency matrix, sparse matrix-vector multiplication is a step of breadth first search.

Poor parts of the Midlands and north of England would get lots of infrastructure investment, helping them to close the productivity gap with London. The country would be “levelled up”.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe idea always seemed a little far-fetched. British governments have been trying to boost productivity outside London for decades, with not much success. And it seems less and less likely that the government will be able to focus on grand new designs as opposed to hasty repair jobs. But something else might happen, to spare Mr Johnson’s blushes. Rather than levelling up, Britain could be about to level down, as London sags.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon was not always the great success it is now. After the second world war the government, which had already pinched the capital with a thick Green Belt, deliberately pushed businesses and citizens out to “new towns” in the Home Counties. Manufacturing declined, as did the docks that had once provided jobs and prosperity. By the 1980s the city’s population had fallen by a quarter from the 8.6m it had hit in 1939. London’s schools and services were famously awful.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the Big Bang deregulated financial services in 1986, the logic of agglomeration reasserted itself and London took off. The creative industries and, in recent years, a thriving tech centre have joined the staples of banking, asset management and business services. Schools, policing and transport have all been transformed. People have flooded in from all continents, making London the world’s most global city.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet some warning signs have been visible for a while. Although London’s population has continued to grow, over the last decade that has been driven by international migration and the birth rate. Between 2008 and 2018, 550,000 more Britons left London than moved to it. People complain of high costs and anxiety. One league table in which London scores poorly is the Office for National Statistics’ rankings of well-being and life satisfaction. Since 2015 migration from the capital has helped reduce the differential between London’s house prices and those in the rest of the country (see chart).\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img src="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200523_BRC642.png">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBut London’s house prices remain double those elsewhere. After housing costs are accounted for Londoners are, on average, worse off than residents of the rest of southern England or Scotland. The chairman of\n<small>\nPWC\n</small>\n, a professional-services firm, has argued that graduates are turning their backs on London. Whereas 60% of graduates working for the big four accounting firms used to be based in the capital, in 2018 60% of new starters were outside.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe London office-cost premium is even higher than the housing-cost one. Prime square footage in the capital costs three times as much as space in other southern cities and seven to nine times as much as elsewhere in Britain. According to a legal recruitment firm, a company can save about £20,000 ($24,500) a year by moving a lawyer out of central London, after office costs and salary are taken into account. “Northshoring”—usually referring, confusingly, to places such as Birmingham that are far from northerly—has become something of a buzzword in the industry.\n<small>\nHSBC\n</small>\nchose to move its British retail banking headquarters to Birmingham in 2017. Amazon, an internet retailer, picked Manchester for its major British corporate site in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the coronavirus crushes property values and office rents, London might become a little less offputting. Perhaps some graduates will be tempted back from Leeds or Manchester. But covid-19 and the extreme social-distancing measures used to combat it pose a new and more profound danger to the capital, for they threaten two factors that have been central to its success: fun and foreigners.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon’s triumph is at least partially based on it being a fun place to live. “People come here not only because you can get paid well but because you can have a good time,” says Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy. The bars and cafes of the East End have been an important driver of what Mr McWillams once dubbed the “flat white economy”, where people with interesting hair bounce ideas off each other while drinking trendy beverages.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt is hard to have a flat white economy when you have to maintain two-metre distancing while queuing for your caffeine. Restaurateurs fear that being forced to operate at a lower capacity will drive many of them out of business. Theatres are facing disaster. As a hedge-fund manager puts it, “London without the culture and the restaurants is just a more expensive Frankfurt with more congestion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCovid-19 might combine with Brexit to cut international migration. Although foreign candidates for London jobs will score better on Britain’s new points-based immigration system than those for jobs elsewhere in the country, because the jobs are better paid, the signal has been sent: Britain is not keen on mass immigration. Universities fear that foreign student numbers could fall by 20-50% in the year ahead. For London, with its more than 100,000 foreign students, that is a problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike all great cities, London could also suffer from changing assumptions about work. Many firms now expect that some people will keep working from home even after the danger of coronavirus has receded—if not every day then several days a week. As firms learn to make do with smaller offices, workers might prize bigger homes outside London where they can have an office. The trade-off between space and commuting time looks different if you only have to go in two or three times a week. But if this happens, it will probably benefit commuter towns in the south-east rather than the northern and Midlands towns that Mr Johnson wanted to help.\n</p>\n<p>\nLisa Taylor of Coherent Cities, a consultancy, remains optimistic. “The next two years are going to be very tough,” she argues.“But a different city could emerge on the other side. One where land use has changed, where we have more co-working and co-living spaces.” She reckons that a greener, less congested London could take its inspiration from cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But those are hardly world-beating metropolises.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon is unlikely to slip back into the dismal state it was in before the mid-1980s. It is likely to remain richer and more productive than the rest of Britain. It will remain Europe’s most powerful magnet for talented immigrants. Still, its pulling power is likely to wane. If that happens, Britain’s economy will probably suffer. But a less centralised country, in which opportunity was more evenly distributed, might be a better place in other ways.\n<span>\n■\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\nEditor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of\n</em>\nThe Economist Today\n<em>\n, our daily\n<a href="https://my.economist.com/user#newsletter">\nnewsletter\n</a>\n.

They sat in a circle at a house in the hills a few hours north of San Francisco — where wine country becomes weed country — to discuss the therapeutic potential of CBD, and how to get people to take it seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeveral studies in rodents and in cell cultures had\n<a title href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462008000300015&lng=en&tlng=en">\nsuggested\n</a>\nthat CBD, a nonintoxicating compound from the cannabis plant more formally known as cannabidiol, could protect the nervous system, modulate blood flow, slow the growth of cancer cells and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We were talking about, ‘What can we do with this?’ ” recalled Samantha Miller, who hosted the event at her split-level house, wedged between redwoods and a creek below. A headstrong biochemist, she had been growing marijuana since the age of 14 and had just quit a six-figure job to start her own cannabis testing lab\n<strong>\n.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSamantha Miller at her home in northern California.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA ragtag crew of activists, doctors, writers and marijuana farmers met to discuss the potential of CBD in 2011 at Samantha Miller’s home.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nAfter two years of tracking down high-CBD pot plants and building momentum, the group began to devise ways to persuade more farmers to grow strains with CBD — which had largely been bred out of American pot since it doesn’t get you high. In addition to convincing marijuana dispensaries to widely carry CBD, they wanted to educate the public about its promising benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the group of ten or so brainstormed, a balloon of vaporized pot was passed in one direction and a bong in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There was a strong sense that this was really going to be something, if when people use these strains they have any kind of experience like the mice did in the laboratories,” said Martin Lee, a writer who at the time had been finishing a book\n<a title href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Smoke_Signals.html?id=8XE-AAAAQBAJ">\nabout the social history of marijuana\n</a>\nfor Simon &amp; Schuster.\n</p>\n<p>\nNear him was Stacey Kerr, a physician with flowing silver hair who served as treasurer of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, as well as Wade Laughter, a soft-spoken man in glasses who had started cultivating pot for his glaucoma in the mid-90s. Mr. Laughter and Lawrence Ringo, an old-school hippie grower, were some of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC — the compound that does get you high. Both pledged to keep their strains available for other growers at cheap prices. (Mr. Ringo said he would sell his seeds for as little as $5.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, there was Fred Gardner, a writer who had recruited almost all of these people to the CBD cause. A Harvard-educated former antiwar activist, now 78, Mr. Gardner had been writing about CBD since the late 1990s for publications like Synapse,\n<a title href="https://synapse.library.ucsf.edu/?a=d&d=ucsf19990701-01.2.4&srpos=2&e=-------en--20--1--txt-fred+gardner+gw-----txIN--">\nthe U.C. San Francisco weekly\n</a>\n. For years, he’d been determined to connect the nascent CBD research he heard about at symposiums abroad with the medical marijuana movement in California. And with this group, finally, it seemed to be coming together.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller spent the months after this meeting leading hundreds of CBD seminars for farmers; Dr. Kerr began informal patient surveys to track how CBD made people feel; and as he finished his book, Mr. Lee often traveled around with Mr. Laughter and Mr. Ringo’s high-CBD plants and seeds, spreading the gospel at pot shops across the West.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was aware that this was a pretty special moment,” Dr. Kerr told me, talking about the night at Ms. Miller’s. “That it was the beginning of something big, and we were there to see it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAt the time of Samantha Miller’s summit in 2011\n</strong>\n, THC was the sole chemical “face” of the plant. Cannabis containing significant amounts of CBD was still rare. Police raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana businesses were still common. And because CBD doesn’t get you high, it was easy to miss; hardly anyone outside of pharmaceutical companies and academia had heard of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the nine years since that night in the woods, one of the group’s biggest goals has clearly been accomplished: People know about CBD.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/opinion/24lewis4/merlin_170651910_ce93e3a5-32dd-4c3c-8a14-3e9a5751f199-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nIt has been estimated that the U.S. CBD industry will be worth $16 billion by 2025.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nJennifer Aniston loves beauty products made with it.

That’s because the federal government’s insistence that cannabis has no legitimate use as a medicine created two enormous problems: the proliferation of fake CBD products and the nonsensical separation of CBD from THC.\n</p>\n<p>\nClinical studies\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16209908">\nhave shown\n</a>\nthat CBD is most effective when paired with at least some THC, even if it is not enough to cause a high. However, the United States considers cannabis with THC to be a Schedule 1 drug — which puts it in the same category as heroin, indicating a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This makes further research very difficult to do, and causes sick people in many states to be treated as criminals.\n</p>\n<p>\nCannabis that is high in CBD but extremely low in THC was made legal at the end of 2018. But finding an easy, affordable test that is able to distinguish cannabis with THC from cannabis without THC has been prohibitively difficult\n<a title href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/02/21/hot-hemp-pits-states-against-feds">\nfor farmers\n</a>\nand\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/cbd-thc-cannabis-cannabidiol.html">\ncrime labs\n</a>\nalike. So federal agencies have been\n<a title href="https://hempindustrydaily.com/fda-cbd-regulation-delay-is-costing-profits-and-shelf-space/">\nslow to regulate\n</a>\nthe booming industry — leading to a deluge of tinctures, smoothies and lotions that trusted tests have shown contain no CBD at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the absence of oversight, the push to get more patients access to cannabis medicine — and bona fide CBD — has been co-opted by a push to make as much money as possible off the next big wellness fad. “At a certain point, it had a life of its own,” Ms. Miller told me.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, the CBD industry promises a miracle drug but is often selling a placebo: cannabidiol products with zero cannabidiol inside. As a result, the compound is often caricatured as snake oil, a scam, even as promising research into the full potential of CBD is starting to pick up.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe compound’s reputation is a microcosm of what it means to be in America right now: a thing that some of us consider a hoax and others praise as the solution to everything. But CBD’s rollicking journey from the international underground to cultural ubiquity proves that, as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAs marijuana use increased in the 1960s and ’70s\n</strong>\n, and the Nixon administration criminalized drugs to vilify what\n<a title href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">\none aide described\n</a>\nas “the antiwar left and black people,” the more science-minded side of the government began funding some basic cannabis research. A man named Carlton Turner helped establish the government’s Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi. After that, he became President Ronald Reagan’s drug czar, helping to\n<a title href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-10-26-8603200589-story.html">\nexpand the War on Drugs\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut all the while, Mr. Turner was in touch with a Brazilian scientist named Elisaldo Carlini who had done\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7028792">\nsmall-scale human studies\n</a>\nshowing CBD reduced seizures: “All the early work on CBD was Carlini in Brazil,” Mr. Turner told me this past summer. “We were in communication for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFor decades, Dr. Carlini’s research was not replicated, in part because so few people had access to the compound: Both the pot held at the nation’s sole government-sanctioned marijuana lab at the University of Mississippi and the illegal pot being smoked around the country had only trace CBD content. (Mr. Turner even tested several kinds of cannabis sent by a legendary pot grower, a writer for “High Times” named Mel Frank. To no avail: none of it contained much CBD.)\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nCarlton Turner helped establish the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nThe University of Mississippi\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nIn those years, emissaries of California’s counterculture were often traveling the world looking for unique strains of cannabis. The most influential of these collectors was a man named David Watson. In the early 70s, Mr. Watson sold his possessions and began hitchhiking from Morocco to India, befriending local pot growers along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Watson ultimately settled in Amsterdam to examine his thousands of kinds of cannabis at his own Dutch state-licensed company, HortaPharm BV. He brought in a friend, an American botanist named Robert Connell Clarke to help. When Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke heard about the CBD research Dr. Carlini had done in Brazil, the pair identified and then bred CBD varietals. This led to a discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It attenuates the high,” Mr. Clarke told me over breakfast in Los Angeles. “That came strictly from anecdotal stoner evidence.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA marijuana plant.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nRobert Connell Clarke was an influential collector of unique strains of cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, after multiple sclerosis patients in England became more vocal about how cannabis helped their symptoms, the country allowed a small pharmaceutical company led by a British physician named\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nDr. Geoffrey Guy\n</a>\nto develop plant-derived cannabis medicines; GW Pharmaceuticals\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nlicensed varietals\n</a>\nbred from Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke’s collection of cannabis and got to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Within a couple of years, they figured out a 1:1 combination of a high-THC chemovar and a high-CBD chemovar presented the greatest latitude of effects and prevention of side effects,” said Dr. Ethan Russo, who worked with GW Pharmaceuticals from 1998 to 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke had discovered, having CBD in the mix reduced THC’s more uncomfortable effects: sedation, inebriation, a faster heart rate. And though a few outliers responded well to CBD alone, GW’s data showed that for relieving pain and inflammation, helping with sleep and alleviating seizures and spasms, most patients got the most benefit from an equal mix of CBD and THC — a drug the company called\n<a title href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-feb-01-me-medpot1-story.html">\nSativex\n</a>\n. But the research wasn’t enough. Although the drug has been approved for use in around 30 countries, the F.D.A. has yet to approve Sativex in the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nMr. Gardner, the writer whose CBD advocacy\n</strong>\neventually inspired the 2011 summit\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA copy of O’Shaughnessy’s, the Journal of Cannabis in Clinical Practice, from 2011.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nFred Gardner in his home on March 2, 2020.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nEnter, three years later, one of Oakland’s pioneering pot entrepreneurs, a medical marijuana impresario with pigtail braids named Steve DeAngelo. Mr. DeAngelo, who had been in contact with Mr. Gardner about the urgent need to institute better testing, agreed to help fund a cannabis analysis lab, Steep Hill, which began its operations in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Gardner came by frequently, chatting and checking in to see if Steep Hill’s founders had discovered the elusive compound. And at last, in February 2009 a dual peak on a testing graph appeared, indicating the presence of CBD.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I remember the moment,” said David Lampach, one of the lab’s funders and co-founders. “Seeing the dual peak and realizing it was real, and running it like five times to make sure.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the summer of 2009, the lab had identified five strains with significant CBD and THC. Mr. Gardner was elated, and began referring to his efforts as “Project CBD” alongside other supporters, including Mr. Lee, the writer. “Right away the thought was: ‘What is the government going to say about this? How can they be against something that’s nonintoxicating?’ ” Mr. Lee said.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June of 2010, the host of the 2011 summit, the biochemist Ms. Miller, opened her own lab, Pure Analytics. A few months later, she called Mr. Ringo, the hippie grower, to let him know a pot sample he sent in was a strain with a lot of CBD — as much as 11 percent.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nContainers of a cannabis flower samples at the Steep Hill lab, which began operations in 2008.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA technician macerating cannabis flower samples at Pure Analytics.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n“He’s in the trim room on speaker, and this big whoop goes up,” she said, remembering his staff’s excitement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 2010, a\n<a title href="https://www.projectcbd.org/">\nProject CBD\n</a>\nwebsite was set up where anyone could look through studies organized by disease or condition. Mr. Lee took charge of running it and it began to attract an audience. A few months later, the network of early CBD advocates met up at Ms. Miller’s house in California to coordinate their evangelism. And by the middle of 2011, word of cannabidiol had permeated the population that would become its most potent promotional engine: the chronically ill, people with cancer, with ALS, with serious disorders that weren’t responding to prescription drugs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs stories about CBD’s power spread, demand increased and prices rose. Sick people often relied on the generosity of growers like Mr. Ringo, his son Dakota told me.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nLawrence Ringo in Blocksburg, Calif., about 2010. He was of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKathleen Hart\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n“I’d go up there and see people dying of cancer hanging out with him, and he’d be hooking them up with oil he made in his house,” the younger Mr. Ringo said. Mike Hyde, whose son was suffering from brain cancer, spent months driving around Colorado and the West Coast looking for CBD in late 2011, before connecting with Mr. Ringo at a restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d never met this guy before, and he brought us literally probably $30,000 worth of oil for this CBD that no one could even get,” Mr. Hyde explained. “For free.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCBD’s big launch into the mainstream came when the world saw evidence of what Dr. Carlini had discovered in Brazil, back in the 1970s: the compound’s ability to quell seizures. Unlike a reduction in pain, this was something any politician or camera crew could easily see. It wasn’t a stoner scam.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, in December 2011, an epileptic child used CBD on the Discovery Channel’s “Weed Wars,” a show featuring the co-founder of the Steep Hill lab, Mr. DeAngelo. The following year, the parents of an epileptic boy in San Francisco\n<a title href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/medical-marijuana-epilepsy/">\nbought\n</a>\nCBD from a pot shop. Then, looking for a better quality product, they contacted GW Pharmaceuticals — the British company that had licensed the cannabis collection of those globe-trotting 20th century cannabis collectors, Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke, and which conducted the research in the ’90s that spurred Mr. Gardner’s CBD advocacy. The\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\ncompany developed\n</a>\na 98 percent CBD drug for the boy and others like him.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteve DeAngelo, a pioneering pot entrepreneur.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\n‘Bubba D’ plants in the Clones &amp; Seeds section of Harborside, one of the first dispensary to laboratory test cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nPerhaps the most critical turning point for CBD came in August 2013, when a CNN special hosted by Dr. Sanjay Gupta profiled a 6-year-old girl in Colorado, Charlotte Figi, who used CBD to treat her epilepsy, as well as the brawny brothers who grew her CBD, the Stanleys. Hundreds of families — witnessing the power of CBD enhanced by cable news production values — moved to Colorado to gain access to the Stanleys’ CBD oil, called Charlotte’s Web. The Stanleys told me their wait-list peaked at 15,000 names. And because of public demand, the F.D.A. fast-tracked clinical trials of GW Pharmaceuticals’ 98 percent CBD drug, Epidiolex.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly, everyone wanted CBD, even though no one quite understood it. In the confusion, there was money to be made. Mere weeks after the CNN documentary aired, the spike in CBD interest prompted the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n<a title href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2013/finra-warns-investors-marijuana-stock-scams">\nto issue an investor alert\n</a>\non marijuana stock scams: As the F.D.A. would\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/warning-letters-and-test-results-cannabidiol-related-products">\nlater show\n</a>\n, many online CBD products contained little or no CBD whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIn 2020, CBD is available three ways:\n</strong>\nover the counter; at state-licensed marijuana dispensaries; or if you have certain forms of epilepsy, from GW Pharmaceuticals. Most Americans encounter CBD in the first and most unreliable way — at, say, a bodega in Brooklyn or a health food store in Indiana. A consultant hired to do an investigation by a corporate chain recently told me that the percentage of over-the-counter CBD products that contained the amount on the label was “in the single digits.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs if CBD’s back story couldn’t get any weirder, the path to this glut of phony CBD was paved by, of all people, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnrelated to the brouhaha on the West Coast, tobacco farmers in Kentucky were seeking a new cash crop. In 2011, James Comer won the race for Kentucky state agriculture commissioner by promising to legalize industrial hemp.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That raised a lot of eyebrows, including in McConnell’s office,” Eric Steenstra, a hemp lobbyist, told me. “They saw the winds were shifting.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlong with Representative Jared Polis, now the governor of Colorado, Mr. McConnell included a hemp pilot program in the 2014 farm bill — for “research.” In the legislation, hemp was defined as cannabis containing\n<a title href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/">\nless than 0.3 percent THC\n</a>\n— an arbitrary threshold, not a scientific distinction: Nothing in the Farm Bill, in case law, or in the Controlled Substances Act seemed to say anything about CBD. So entrepreneurs interpreted this research-oriented pilot program as the de facto legalization of cannabidiol.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration disagreed, but couldn’t stop the tidal wave of CBD production. In 2018,\n<a title href="https://www.kyagr.com/marketing/hemp-overview.html">\nover 60 percent\n</a>\nof the hemp crop in Kentucky was grown for CBD. Then, long after the country was already flooded with CBD products both dubious and legitimate, Mr. McConnell inserted language into the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly making hemp\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process">\nfederally legal\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany of the Californians who plotted at Ms. Miller’s house in 2011 have watched in frustration as the CBD industry flourished, divorced from THC, and fake CBD misled consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn his deathbed in 2014, Mr. Ringo insisted to friends and family that the Stanleys used his seeds to develop their famous strain Charlotte’s Web. Joel Stanley told me the genetics for Charlotte’s Web were a “cross of wild hemp with an industry genetic.” Critics of the Stanley brothers in the cannabis industry have grown annoyed by their prominence and push for patents. Their company has been valued at over half a billion dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller, who still runs a cannabis testing lab, told me that in the years since the 2011 summit, she has become disillusioned as people she’d thought had earnest intentions in spreading CBD turned out to just want to get rich. Mr. Gardner feels the same way.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteep Hill provides cannabis testing services to cultivators, processors, dispensaries, collectives and authorized medical cannabis patients.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nThere has been a slight uptick in clinical research around the compound’s relation to anxiety, schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. In September, the National Institutes of Health\n<a title href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-investigate-minor-cannabinoids-terpenes-potential-pain-relieving-properties">\napproved\n</a>\n$3 million in small grants for studies of cannabidiol and other non-THC cannabis compounds. Nevertheless, the government-enabled ham-handed rush to profiteering has seriously, and unduly, undermined CBD’s medical reputation.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven Dr. Turner, Mr. Reagan’s drug czar, said there is far more evidence for the benefits of Sativex, the half-CBD, half-THC drug, than for unregulated CBD online.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There haven’t been enough clinical trials and there never will be,” said Mr. Clarke, the cannabis seed collector. “There’s no vested financial interest in anyone doing it.” Big Pharma is most invested in medications that they can control, that they alone can patent.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill, some of the states with legal cannabis have implemented robust testing standards, and bona fide CBD can be found at many marijuana dispensaries, both on its own and in a variety of ratios with THC. Ms. Miller’s lab, and other responsible actors, are supposed to ensure products that hit legal pot shop shelves contain exactly what they claim to contain. But without stringent federal oversight, few in the CBD business will voluntarily opt-in to tests of their product labeling’s accuracy.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen I asked Dr. Russo, who oversaw much of GW Pharmaceuticals’ research, how he feels about it all, he sighed. “You do something, and other people run with it, and it turns into something else that you don’t recognize,” he said. “I’m always concerned, but what I like to dwell upon is: What is the real potential here?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Chicago Lewis (\n<a title href="https://twitter.com/msamandalewis">\n@msamandalewis\n</a>\n) is an investigative reporter, focusing on drug policy.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners.

If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people.

We believe that it is critical to move quickly and define such a standard, thereby freeing up researchers to innovate and diversify at the level of higher level algorithms and graph analytics applications. This effort was inspired by the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) of dense Linear Algebra, and hence our working name for this standard is “the GraphBLAS”.\n</p>\n<p>\nA key insight behind this work is that when a graph is represented by a sparse incidence or adjacency matrix, sparse matrix-vector multiplication is a step of breadth first search. By generalizing the pair of scalar operations involved in the linear algebra computations to define a semiring, we can extend the range of these primitives to support a wide range of parallel graph algorithms.\n</p>\n<h1>\n<span>\nMore information\n</span>\n</h1>\n<p>\nA C reference implementation, SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS, can be downloaded from\n<a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur 2013 manifesto for this project can be found\n<a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/PAPERS/GraphPrimitives-HPEC.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe mathematical definition of the GraphBLAS can be found\n<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kepner/GraphBLAS/GraphBLAS-Math-release.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBackground information about graphs in the language of linear algebra can be found in the book:\n<a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/se22/">\nGraph Algorithms in the Language of Linear Algebra\n</a>\n, edited by J.

Poor parts of the Midlands and north of England would get lots of infrastructure investment, helping them to close the productivity gap with London. The country would be “levelled up”.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe idea always seemed a little far-fetched. British governments have been trying to boost productivity outside London for decades, with not much success. And it seems less and less likely that the government will be able to focus on grand new designs as opposed to hasty repair jobs. But something else might happen, to spare Mr Johnson’s blushes. Rather than levelling up, Britain could be about to level down, as London sags.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon was not always the great success it is now. After the second world war the government, which had already pinched the capital with a thick Green Belt, deliberately pushed businesses and citizens out to “new towns” in the Home Counties. Manufacturing declined, as did the docks that had once provided jobs and prosperity. By the 1980s the city’s population had fallen by a quarter from the 8.6m it had hit in 1939. London’s schools and services were famously awful.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the Big Bang deregulated financial services in 1986, the logic of agglomeration reasserted itself and London took off. The creative industries and, in recent years, a thriving tech centre have joined the staples of banking, asset management and business services. Schools, policing and transport have all been transformed. People have flooded in from all continents, making London the world’s most global city.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet some warning signs have been visible for a while. Although London’s population has continued to grow, over the last decade that has been driven by international migration and the birth rate. Between 2008 and 2018, 550,000 more Britons left London than moved to it. People complain of high costs and anxiety. One league table in which London scores poorly is the Office for National Statistics’ rankings of well-being and life satisfaction. Since 2015 migration from the capital has helped reduce the differential between London’s house prices and those in the rest of the country (see chart).\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img src="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200523_BRC642.png">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBut London’s house prices remain double those elsewhere. After housing costs are accounted for Londoners are, on average, worse off than residents of the rest of southern England or Scotland. The chairman of\n<small>\nPWC\n</small>\n, a professional-services firm, has argued that graduates are turning their backs on London. Whereas 60% of graduates working for the big four accounting firms used to be based in the capital, in 2018 60% of new starters were outside.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe London office-cost premium is even higher than the housing-cost one. Prime square footage in the capital costs three times as much as space in other southern cities and seven to nine times as much as elsewhere in Britain. According to a legal recruitment firm, a company can save about £20,000 ($24,500) a year by moving a lawyer out of central London, after office costs and salary are taken into account. “Northshoring”—usually referring, confusingly, to places such as Birmingham that are far from northerly—has become something of a buzzword in the industry.\n<small>\nHSBC\n</small>\nchose to move its British retail banking headquarters to Birmingham in 2017. Amazon, an internet retailer, picked Manchester for its major British corporate site in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the coronavirus crushes property values and office rents, London might become a little less offputting. Perhaps some graduates will be tempted back from Leeds or Manchester. But covid-19 and the extreme social-distancing measures used to combat it pose a new and more profound danger to the capital, for they threaten two factors that have been central to its success: fun and foreigners.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon’s triumph is at least partially based on it being a fun place to live. “People come here not only because you can get paid well but because you can have a good time,” says Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy. The bars and cafes of the East End have been an important driver of what Mr McWillams once dubbed the “flat white economy”, where people with interesting hair bounce ideas off each other while drinking trendy beverages.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt is hard to have a flat white economy when you have to maintain two-metre distancing while queuing for your caffeine. Restaurateurs fear that being forced to operate at a lower capacity will drive many of them out of business. Theatres are facing disaster. As a hedge-fund manager puts it, “London without the culture and the restaurants is just a more expensive Frankfurt with more congestion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCovid-19 might combine with Brexit to cut international migration. Although foreign candidates for London jobs will score better on Britain’s new points-based immigration system than those for jobs elsewhere in the country, because the jobs are better paid, the signal has been sent: Britain is not keen on mass immigration. Universities fear that foreign student numbers could fall by 20-50% in the year ahead. For London, with its more than 100,000 foreign students, that is a problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike all great cities, London could also suffer from changing assumptions about work. Many firms now expect that some people will keep working from home even after the danger of coronavirus has receded—if not every day then several days a week. As firms learn to make do with smaller offices, workers might prize bigger homes outside London where they can have an office. The trade-off between space and commuting time looks different if you only have to go in two or three times a week. But if this happens, it will probably benefit commuter towns in the south-east rather than the northern and Midlands towns that Mr Johnson wanted to help.\n</p>\n<p>\nLisa Taylor of Coherent Cities, a consultancy, remains optimistic. “The next two years are going to be very tough,” she argues.“But a different city could emerge on the other side. One where land use has changed, where we have more co-working and co-living spaces.” She reckons that a greener, less congested London could take its inspiration from cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But those are hardly world-beating metropolises.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon is unlikely to slip back into the dismal state it was in before the mid-1980s. It is likely to remain richer and more productive than the rest of Britain. It will remain Europe’s most powerful magnet for talented immigrants. Still, its pulling power is likely to wane. If that happens, Britain’s economy will probably suffer.

They sat in a circle at a house in the hills a few hours north of San Francisco — where wine country becomes weed country — to discuss the therapeutic potential of CBD, and how to get people to take it seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeveral studies in rodents and in cell cultures had\n<a title href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462008000300015&lng=en&tlng=en">\nsuggested\n</a>\nthat CBD, a nonintoxicating compound from the cannabis plant more formally known as cannabidiol, could protect the nervous system, modulate blood flow, slow the growth of cancer cells and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We were talking about, ‘What can we do with this?’ ” recalled Samantha Miller, who hosted the event at her split-level house, wedged between redwoods and a creek below. A headstrong biochemist, she had been growing marijuana since the age of 14 and had just quit a six-figure job to start her own cannabis testing lab\n<strong>\n.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSamantha Miller at her home in northern California.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA ragtag crew of activists, doctors, writers and marijuana farmers met to discuss the potential of CBD in 2011 at Samantha Miller’s home.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nAfter two years of tracking down high-CBD pot plants and building momentum, the group began to devise ways to persuade more farmers to grow strains with CBD — which had largely been bred out of American pot since it doesn’t get you high. In addition to convincing marijuana dispensaries to widely carry CBD, they wanted to educate the public about its promising benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the group of ten or so brainstormed, a balloon of vaporized pot was passed in one direction and a bong in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There was a strong sense that this was really going to be something, if when people use these strains they have any kind of experience like the mice did in the laboratories,” said Martin Lee, a writer who at the time had been finishing a book\n<a title href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Smoke_Signals.html?id=8XE-AAAAQBAJ">\nabout the social history of marijuana\n</a>\nfor Simon &amp; Schuster.\n</p>\n<p>\nNear him was Stacey Kerr, a physician with flowing silver hair who served as treasurer of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, as well as Wade Laughter, a soft-spoken man in glasses who had started cultivating pot for his glaucoma in the mid-90s. Mr. Laughter and Lawrence Ringo, an old-school hippie grower, were some of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC — the compound that does get you high. Both pledged to keep their strains available for other growers at cheap prices. (Mr. Ringo said he would sell his seeds for as little as $5.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, there was Fred Gardner, a writer who had recruited almost all of these people to the CBD cause. A Harvard-educated former antiwar activist, now 78, Mr. Gardner had been writing about CBD since the late 1990s for publications like Synapse,\n<a title href="https://synapse.library.ucsf.edu/?a=d&d=ucsf19990701-01.2.4&srpos=2&e=-------en--20--1--txt-fred+gardner+gw-----txIN--">\nthe U.C. San Francisco weekly\n</a>\n. For years, he’d been determined to connect the nascent CBD research he heard about at symposiums abroad with the medical marijuana movement in California. And with this group, finally, it seemed to be coming together.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller spent the months after this meeting leading hundreds of CBD seminars for farmers; Dr. Kerr began informal patient surveys to track how CBD made people feel; and as he finished his book, Mr. Lee often traveled around with Mr. Laughter and Mr. Ringo’s high-CBD plants and seeds, spreading the gospel at pot shops across the West.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was aware that this was a pretty special moment,” Dr. Kerr told me, talking about the night at Ms. Miller’s. “That it was the beginning of something big, and we were there to see it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAt the time of Samantha Miller’s summit in 2011\n</strong>\n, THC was the sole chemical “face” of the plant. Cannabis containing significant amounts of CBD was still rare. Police raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana businesses were still common. And because CBD doesn’t get you high, it was easy to miss; hardly anyone outside of pharmaceutical companies and academia had heard of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the nine years since that night in the woods, one of the group’s biggest goals has clearly been accomplished: People know about CBD.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/opinion/24lewis4/merlin_170651910_ce93e3a5-32dd-4c3c-8a14-3e9a5751f199-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nIt has been estimated that the U.S. CBD industry will be worth $16 billion by 2025.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nJennifer Aniston loves beauty products made with it.

And e-commerce sales of CBD\n<a title href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/cbd-e-commerce-sales-are-booming-with-the-world-battling-covid-19-2020-04-06-71975826?mod=mw_quote_news">\nhave grown\n</a>\nthis year amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the CBD landscape of 2020 looks nothing like what the activists and scientists intended. That’s because the federal government’s insistence that cannabis has no legitimate use as a medicine created two enormous problems: the proliferation of fake CBD products and the nonsensical separation of CBD from THC.\n</p>\n<p>\nClinical studies\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16209908">\nhave shown\n</a>\nthat CBD is most effective when paired with at least some THC, even if it is not enough to cause a high. However, the United States considers cannabis with THC to be a Schedule 1 drug — which puts it in the same category as heroin, indicating a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This makes further research very difficult to do, and causes sick people in many states to be treated as criminals.\n</p>\n<p>\nCannabis that is high in CBD but extremely low in THC was made legal at the end of 2018. But finding an easy, affordable test that is able to distinguish cannabis with THC from cannabis without THC has been prohibitively difficult\n<a title href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/02/21/hot-hemp-pits-states-against-feds">\nfor farmers\n</a>\nand\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/cbd-thc-cannabis-cannabidiol.html">\ncrime labs\n</a>\nalike. So federal agencies have been\n<a title href="https://hempindustrydaily.com/fda-cbd-regulation-delay-is-costing-profits-and-shelf-space/">\nslow to regulate\n</a>\nthe booming industry — leading to a deluge of tinctures, smoothies and lotions that trusted tests have shown contain no CBD at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the absence of oversight, the push to get more patients access to cannabis medicine — and bona fide CBD — has been co-opted by a push to make as much money as possible off the next big wellness fad. “At a certain point, it had a life of its own,” Ms. Miller told me.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, the CBD industry promises a miracle drug but is often selling a placebo: cannabidiol products with zero cannabidiol inside. As a result, the compound is often caricatured as snake oil, a scam, even as promising research into the full potential of CBD is starting to pick up.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe compound’s reputation is a microcosm of what it means to be in America right now: a thing that some of us consider a hoax and others praise as the solution to everything. But CBD’s rollicking journey from the international underground to cultural ubiquity proves that, as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAs marijuana use increased in the 1960s and ’70s\n</strong>\n, and the Nixon administration criminalized drugs to vilify what\n<a title href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">\none aide described\n</a>\nas “the antiwar left and black people,” the more science-minded side of the government began funding some basic cannabis research. A man named Carlton Turner helped establish the government’s Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi. After that, he became President Ronald Reagan’s drug czar, helping to\n<a title href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-10-26-8603200589-story.html">\nexpand the War on Drugs\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut all the while, Mr. Turner was in touch with a Brazilian scientist named Elisaldo Carlini who had done\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7028792">\nsmall-scale human studies\n</a>\nshowing CBD reduced seizures: “All the early work on CBD was Carlini in Brazil,” Mr. Turner told me this past summer. “We were in communication for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFor decades, Dr. Carlini’s research was not replicated, in part because so few people had access to the compound: Both the pot held at the nation’s sole government-sanctioned marijuana lab at the University of Mississippi and the illegal pot being smoked around the country had only trace CBD content. (Mr. Turner even tested several kinds of cannabis sent by a legendary pot grower, a writer for “High Times” named Mel Frank. To no avail: none of it contained much CBD.)\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nCarlton Turner helped establish the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nThe University of Mississippi\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nIn those years, emissaries of California’s counterculture were often traveling the world looking for unique strains of cannabis. The most influential of these collectors was a man named David Watson. In the early 70s, Mr. Watson sold his possessions and began hitchhiking from Morocco to India, befriending local pot growers along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Watson ultimately settled in Amsterdam to examine his thousands of kinds of cannabis at his own Dutch state-licensed company, HortaPharm BV. He brought in a friend, an American botanist named Robert Connell Clarke to help. When Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke heard about the CBD research Dr. Carlini had done in Brazil, the pair identified and then bred CBD varietals. This led to a discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It attenuates the high,” Mr. Clarke told me over breakfast in Los Angeles. “That came strictly from anecdotal stoner evidence.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA marijuana plant.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nRobert Connell Clarke was an influential collector of unique strains of cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, after multiple sclerosis patients in England became more vocal about how cannabis helped their symptoms, the country allowed a small pharmaceutical company led by a British physician named\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nDr. Geoffrey Guy\n</a>\nto develop plant-derived cannabis medicines; GW Pharmaceuticals\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nlicensed varietals\n</a>\nbred from Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke’s collection of cannabis and got to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Within a couple of years, they figured out a 1:1 combination of a high-THC chemovar and a high-CBD chemovar presented the greatest latitude of effects and prevention of side effects,” said Dr. Ethan Russo, who worked with GW Pharmaceuticals from 1998 to 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke had discovered, having CBD in the mix reduced THC’s more uncomfortable effects: sedation, inebriation, a faster heart rate. And though a few outliers responded well to CBD alone, GW’s data showed that for relieving pain and inflammation, helping with sleep and alleviating seizures and spasms, most patients got the most benefit from an equal mix of CBD and THC — a drug the company called\n<a title href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-feb-01-me-medpot1-story.html">\nSativex\n</a>\n. But the research wasn’t enough. Although the drug has been approved for use in around 30 countries, the F.D.A. has yet to approve Sativex in the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nMr. Gardner, the writer whose CBD advocacy\n</strong>\neventually inspired the 2011 summit\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA copy of O’Shaughnessy’s, the Journal of Cannabis in Clinical Practice, from 2011.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nFred Gardner in his home on March 2, 2020.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nEnter, three years later, one of Oakland’s pioneering pot entrepreneurs, a medical marijuana impresario with pigtail braids named Steve DeAngelo. Mr. DeAngelo, who had been in contact with Mr. Gardner about the urgent need to institute better testing, agreed to help fund a cannabis analysis lab, Steep Hill, which began its operations in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Gardner came by frequently, chatting and checking in to see if Steep Hill’s founders had discovered the elusive compound. And at last, in February 2009 a dual peak on a testing graph appeared, indicating the presence of CBD.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I remember the moment,” said David Lampach, one of the lab’s funders and co-founders. “Seeing the dual peak and realizing it was real, and running it like five times to make sure.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the summer of 2009, the lab had identified five strains with significant CBD and THC. Mr. Gardner was elated, and began referring to his efforts as “Project CBD” alongside other supporters, including Mr. Lee, the writer. “Right away the thought was: ‘What is the government going to say about this? How can they be against something that’s nonintoxicating?’ ” Mr. Lee said.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June of 2010, the host of the 2011 summit, the biochemist Ms. Miller, opened her own lab, Pure Analytics. A few months later, she called Mr. Ringo, the hippie grower, to let him know a pot sample he sent in was a strain with a lot of CBD — as much as 11 percent.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nContainers of a cannabis flower samples at the Steep Hill lab, which began operations in 2008.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA technician macerating cannabis flower samples at Pure Analytics.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n“He’s in the trim room on speaker, and this big whoop goes up,” she said, remembering his staff’s excitement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 2010, a\n<a title href="https://www.projectcbd.org/">\nProject CBD\n</a>\nwebsite was set up where anyone could look through studies organized by disease or condition. Mr. Lee took charge of running it and it began to attract an audience. A few months later, the network of early CBD advocates met up at Ms. Miller’s house in California to coordinate their evangelism. And by the middle of 2011, word of cannabidiol had permeated the population that would become its most potent promotional engine: the chronically ill, people with cancer, with ALS, with serious disorders that weren’t responding to prescription drugs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs stories about CBD’s power spread, demand increased and prices rose. Sick people often relied on the generosity of growers like Mr. Ringo, his son Dakota told me.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nLawrence Ringo in Blocksburg, Calif., about 2010. He was of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKathleen Hart\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n“I’d go up there and see people dying of cancer hanging out with him, and he’d be hooking them up with oil he made in his house,” the younger Mr. Ringo said. Mike Hyde, whose son was suffering from brain cancer, spent months driving around Colorado and the West Coast looking for CBD in late 2011, before connecting with Mr. Ringo at a restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d never met this guy before, and he brought us literally probably $30,000 worth of oil for this CBD that no one could even get,” Mr. Hyde explained. “For free.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCBD’s big launch into the mainstream came when the world saw evidence of what Dr. Carlini had discovered in Brazil, back in the 1970s: the compound’s ability to quell seizures. Unlike a reduction in pain, this was something any politician or camera crew could easily see. It wasn’t a stoner scam.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, in December 2011, an epileptic child used CBD on the Discovery Channel’s “Weed Wars,” a show featuring the co-founder of the Steep Hill lab, Mr. DeAngelo. The following year, the parents of an epileptic boy in San Francisco\n<a title href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/medical-marijuana-epilepsy/">\nbought\n</a>\nCBD from a pot shop. Then, looking for a better quality product, they contacted GW Pharmaceuticals — the British company that had licensed the cannabis collection of those globe-trotting 20th century cannabis collectors, Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke, and which conducted the research in the ’90s that spurred Mr. Gardner’s CBD advocacy. The\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\ncompany developed\n</a>\na 98 percent CBD drug for the boy and others like him.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteve DeAngelo, a pioneering pot entrepreneur.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\n‘Bubba D’ plants in the Clones &amp; Seeds section of Harborside, one of the first dispensary to laboratory test cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nPerhaps the most critical turning point for CBD came in August 2013, when a CNN special hosted by Dr. Sanjay Gupta profiled a 6-year-old girl in Colorado, Charlotte Figi, who used CBD to treat her epilepsy, as well as the brawny brothers who grew her CBD, the Stanleys. Hundreds of families — witnessing the power of CBD enhanced by cable news production values — moved to Colorado to gain access to the Stanleys’ CBD oil, called Charlotte’s Web. The Stanleys told me their wait-list peaked at 15,000 names. And because of public demand, the F.D.A. fast-tracked clinical trials of GW Pharmaceuticals’ 98 percent CBD drug, Epidiolex.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly, everyone wanted CBD, even though no one quite understood it. In the confusion, there was money to be made. Mere weeks after the CNN documentary aired, the spike in CBD interest prompted the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n<a title href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2013/finra-warns-investors-marijuana-stock-scams">\nto issue an investor alert\n</a>\non marijuana stock scams: As the F.D.A. would\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/warning-letters-and-test-results-cannabidiol-related-products">\nlater show\n</a>\n, many online CBD products contained little or no CBD whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIn 2020, CBD is available three ways:\n</strong>\nover the counter; at state-licensed marijuana dispensaries; or if you have certain forms of epilepsy, from GW Pharmaceuticals. Most Americans encounter CBD in the first and most unreliable way — at, say, a bodega in Brooklyn or a health food store in Indiana. A consultant hired to do an investigation by a corporate chain recently told me that the percentage of over-the-counter CBD products that contained the amount on the label was “in the single digits.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs if CBD’s back story couldn’t get any weirder, the path to this glut of phony CBD was paved by, of all people, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnrelated to the brouhaha on the West Coast, tobacco farmers in Kentucky were seeking a new cash crop. In 2011, James Comer won the race for Kentucky state agriculture commissioner by promising to legalize industrial hemp.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That raised a lot of eyebrows, including in McConnell’s office,” Eric Steenstra, a hemp lobbyist, told me. “They saw the winds were shifting.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlong with Representative Jared Polis, now the governor of Colorado, Mr. McConnell included a hemp pilot program in the 2014 farm bill — for “research.” In the legislation, hemp was defined as cannabis containing\n<a title href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/">\nless than 0.3 percent THC\n</a>\n— an arbitrary threshold, not a scientific distinction: Nothing in the Farm Bill, in case law, or in the Controlled Substances Act seemed to say anything about CBD. So entrepreneurs interpreted this research-oriented pilot program as the de facto legalization of cannabidiol.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration disagreed, but couldn’t stop the tidal wave of CBD production. In 2018,\n<a title href="https://www.kyagr.com/marketing/hemp-overview.html">\nover 60 percent\n</a>\nof the hemp crop in Kentucky was grown for CBD. Then, long after the country was already flooded with CBD products both dubious and legitimate, Mr. McConnell inserted language into the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly making hemp\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process">\nfederally legal\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany of the Californians who plotted at Ms. Miller’s house in 2011 have watched in frustration as the CBD industry flourished, divorced from THC, and fake CBD misled consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn his deathbed in 2014, Mr. Ringo insisted to friends and family that the Stanleys used his seeds to develop their famous strain Charlotte’s Web. Joel Stanley told me the genetics for Charlotte’s Web were a “cross of wild hemp with an industry genetic.” Critics of the Stanley brothers in the cannabis industry have grown annoyed by their prominence and push for patents. Their company has been valued at over half a billion dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller, who still runs a cannabis testing lab, told me that in the years since the 2011 summit, she has become disillusioned as people she’d thought had earnest intentions in spreading CBD turned out to just want to get rich. Mr. Gardner feels the same way.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteep Hill provides cannabis testing services to cultivators, processors, dispensaries, collectives and authorized medical cannabis patients.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nThere has been a slight uptick in clinical research around the compound’s relation to anxiety, schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. In September, the National Institutes of Health\n<a title href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-investigate-minor-cannabinoids-terpenes-potential-pain-relieving-properties">\napproved\n</a>\n$3 million in small grants for studies of cannabidiol and other non-THC cannabis compounds. Nevertheless, the government-enabled ham-handed rush to profiteering has seriously, and unduly, undermined CBD’s medical reputation.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven Dr. Turner, Mr. Reagan’s drug czar, said there is far more evidence for the benefits of Sativex, the half-CBD, half-THC drug, than for unregulated CBD online.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There haven’t been enough clinical trials and there never will be,” said Mr. Clarke, the cannabis seed collector. “There’s no vested financial interest in anyone doing it.” Big Pharma is most invested in medications that they can control, that they alone can patent.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill, some of the states with legal cannabis have implemented robust testing standards, and bona fide CBD can be found at many marijuana dispensaries, both on its own and in a variety of ratios with THC. Ms. Miller’s lab, and other responsible actors, are supposed to ensure products that hit legal pot shop shelves contain exactly what they claim to contain. But without stringent federal oversight, few in the CBD business will voluntarily opt-in to tests of their product labeling’s accuracy.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen I asked Dr. Russo, who oversaw much of GW Pharmaceuticals’ research, how he feels about it all, he sighed. “You do something, and other people run with it, and it turns into something else that you don’t recognize,” he said. “I’m always concerned, but what I like to dwell upon is: What is the real potential here?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Chicago Lewis (\n<a title href="https://twitter.com/msamandalewis">\n@msamandalewis\n</a>\n) is an investigative reporter, focusing on drug policy.

If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes.

We believe that it is critical to move quickly and define such a standard, thereby freeing up researchers to innovate and diversify at the level of higher level algorithms and graph analytics applications. This effort was inspired by the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) of dense Linear Algebra, and hence our working name for this standard is “the GraphBLAS”.\n</p>\n<p>\nA key insight behind this work is that when a graph is represented by a sparse incidence or adjacency matrix, sparse matrix-vector multiplication is a step of breadth first search. By generalizing the pair of scalar operations involved in the linear algebra computations to define a semiring, we can extend the range of these primitives to support a wide range of parallel graph algorithms.\n</p>\n<h1>\n<span>\nMore information\n</span>\n</h1>\n<p>\nA C reference implementation, SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS, can be downloaded from\n<a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur 2013 manifesto for this project can be found\n<a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/PAPERS/GraphPrimitives-HPEC.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe mathematical definition of the GraphBLAS can be found\n<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kepner/GraphBLAS/GraphBLAS-Math-release.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBackground information about graphs in the language of linear algebra can be found in the book:\n<a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/se22/">\nGraph Algorithms in the Language of Linear Algebra\n</a>\n, edited by J.

Poor parts of the Midlands and north of England would get lots of infrastructure investment, helping them to close the productivity gap with London. The country would be “levelled up”.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe idea always seemed a little far-fetched. British governments have been trying to boost productivity outside London for decades, with not much success. And it seems less and less likely that the government will be able to focus on grand new designs as opposed to hasty repair jobs. But something else might happen, to spare Mr Johnson’s blushes. Rather than levelling up, Britain could be about to level down, as London sags.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon was not always the great success it is now. After the second world war the government, which had already pinched the capital with a thick Green Belt, deliberately pushed businesses and citizens out to “new towns” in the Home Counties. Manufacturing declined, as did the docks that had once provided jobs and prosperity. By the 1980s the city’s population had fallen by a quarter from the 8.6m it had hit in 1939. London’s schools and services were famously awful.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the Big Bang deregulated financial services in 1986, the logic of agglomeration reasserted itself and London took off. The creative industries and, in recent years, a thriving tech centre have joined the staples of banking, asset management and business services. Schools, policing and transport have all been transformed. People have flooded in from all continents, making London the world’s most global city.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet some warning signs have been visible for a while. Although London’s population has continued to grow, over the last decade that has been driven by international migration and the birth rate. Between 2008 and 2018, 550,000 more Britons left London than moved to it. People complain of high costs and anxiety. One league table in which London scores poorly is the Office for National Statistics’ rankings of well-being and life satisfaction. Since 2015 migration from the capital has helped reduce the differential between London’s house prices and those in the rest of the country (see chart).\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img src="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200523_BRC642.png">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBut London’s house prices remain double those elsewhere. After housing costs are accounted for Londoners are, on average, worse off than residents of the rest of southern England or Scotland. The chairman of\n<small>\nPWC\n</small>\n, a professional-services firm, has argued that graduates are turning their backs on London. Whereas 60% of graduates working for the big four accounting firms used to be based in the capital, in 2018 60% of new starters were outside.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe London office-cost premium is even higher than the housing-cost one. Prime square footage in the capital costs three times as much as space in other southern cities and seven to nine times as much as elsewhere in Britain. According to a legal recruitment firm, a company can save about £20,000 ($24,500) a year by moving a lawyer out of central London, after office costs and salary are taken into account. “Northshoring”—usually referring, confusingly, to places such as Birmingham that are far from northerly—has become something of a buzzword in the industry.\n<small>\nHSBC\n</small>\nchose to move its British retail banking headquarters to Birmingham in 2017. Amazon, an internet retailer, picked Manchester for its major British corporate site in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the coronavirus crushes property values and office rents, London might become a little less offputting. Perhaps some graduates will be tempted back from Leeds or Manchester. But covid-19 and the extreme social-distancing measures used to combat it pose a new and more profound danger to the capital, for they threaten two factors that have been central to its success: fun and foreigners.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon’s triumph is at least partially based on it being a fun place to live. “People come here not only because you can get paid well but because you can have a good time,” says Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy. The bars and cafes of the East End have been an important driver of what Mr McWillams once dubbed the “flat white economy”, where people with interesting hair bounce ideas off each other while drinking trendy beverages.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt is hard to have a flat white economy when you have to maintain two-metre distancing while queuing for your caffeine. Restaurateurs fear that being forced to operate at a lower capacity will drive many of them out of business. Theatres are facing disaster. As a hedge-fund manager puts it, “London without the culture and the restaurants is just a more expensive Frankfurt with more congestion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCovid-19 might combine with Brexit to cut international migration. Although foreign candidates for London jobs will score better on Britain’s new points-based immigration system than those for jobs elsewhere in the country, because the jobs are better paid, the signal has been sent: Britain is not keen on mass immigration. Universities fear that foreign student numbers could fall by 20-50% in the year ahead. For London, with its more than 100,000 foreign students, that is a problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike all great cities, London could also suffer from changing assumptions about work. Many firms now expect that some people will keep working from home even after the danger of coronavirus has receded—if not every day then several days a week. As firms learn to make do with smaller offices, workers might prize bigger homes outside London where they can have an office. The trade-off between space and commuting time looks different if you only have to go in two or three times a week. But if this happens, it will probably benefit commuter towns in the south-east rather than the northern and Midlands towns that Mr Johnson wanted to help.\n</p>\n<p>\nLisa Taylor of Coherent Cities, a consultancy, remains optimistic. “The next two years are going to be very tough,” she argues.“But a different city could emerge on the other side. One where land use has changed, where we have more co-working and co-living spaces.” She reckons that a greener, less congested London could take its inspiration from cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But those are hardly world-beating metropolises.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon is unlikely to slip back into the dismal state it was in before the mid-1980s. It is likely to remain richer and more productive than the rest of Britain. It will remain Europe’s most powerful magnet for talented immigrants. Still, its pulling power is likely to wane. If that happens, Britain’s economy will probably suffer. But a less centralised country, in which opportunity was more evenly distributed, might be a better place in other ways.\n<span>\n■\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\nEditor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of\n</em>\nThe Economist Today\n<em>\n, our daily\n<a href="https://my.economist.com/user#newsletter">\nnewsletter\n</a>\n.

They sat in a circle at a house in the hills a few hours north of San Francisco — where wine country becomes weed country — to discuss the therapeutic potential of CBD, and how to get people to take it seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeveral studies in rodents and in cell cultures had\n<a title href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462008000300015&lng=en&tlng=en">\nsuggested\n</a>\nthat CBD, a nonintoxicating compound from the cannabis plant more formally known as cannabidiol, could protect the nervous system, modulate blood flow, slow the growth of cancer cells and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We were talking about, ‘What can we do with this?’ ” recalled Samantha Miller, who hosted the event at her split-level house, wedged between redwoods and a creek below. A headstrong biochemist, she had been growing marijuana since the age of 14 and had just quit a six-figure job to start her own cannabis testing lab\n<strong>\n.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSamantha Miller at her home in northern California.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA ragtag crew of activists, doctors, writers and marijuana farmers met to discuss the potential of CBD in 2011 at Samantha Miller’s home.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nAfter two years of tracking down high-CBD pot plants and building momentum, the group began to devise ways to persuade more farmers to grow strains with CBD — which had largely been bred out of American pot since it doesn’t get you high. In addition to convincing marijuana dispensaries to widely carry CBD, they wanted to educate the public about its promising benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the group of ten or so brainstormed, a balloon of vaporized pot was passed in one direction and a bong in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There was a strong sense that this was really going to be something, if when people use these strains they have any kind of experience like the mice did in the laboratories,” said Martin Lee, a writer who at the time had been finishing a book\n<a title href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Smoke_Signals.html?id=8XE-AAAAQBAJ">\nabout the social history of marijuana\n</a>\nfor Simon &amp; Schuster.\n</p>\n<p>\nNear him was Stacey Kerr, a physician with flowing silver hair who served as treasurer of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, as well as Wade Laughter, a soft-spoken man in glasses who had started cultivating pot for his glaucoma in the mid-90s. Mr. Laughter and Lawrence Ringo, an old-school hippie grower, were some of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC — the compound that does get you high. Both pledged to keep their strains available for other growers at cheap prices. (Mr. Ringo said he would sell his seeds for as little as $5.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, there was Fred Gardner, a writer who had recruited almost all of these people to the CBD cause. A Harvard-educated former antiwar activist, now 78, Mr. Gardner had been writing about CBD since the late 1990s for publications like Synapse,\n<a title href="https://synapse.library.ucsf.edu/?a=d&d=ucsf19990701-01.2.4&srpos=2&e=-------en--20--1--txt-fred+gardner+gw-----txIN--">\nthe U.C. San Francisco weekly\n</a>\n. For years, he’d been determined to connect the nascent CBD research he heard about at symposiums abroad with the medical marijuana movement in California. And with this group, finally, it seemed to be coming together.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller spent the months after this meeting leading hundreds of CBD seminars for farmers; Dr. Kerr began informal patient surveys to track how CBD made people feel; and as he finished his book, Mr. Lee often traveled around with Mr. Laughter and Mr. Ringo’s high-CBD plants and seeds, spreading the gospel at pot shops across the West.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was aware that this was a pretty special moment,” Dr. Kerr told me, talking about the night at Ms. Miller’s. “That it was the beginning of something big, and we were there to see it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAt the time of Samantha Miller’s summit in 2011\n</strong>\n, THC was the sole chemical “face” of the plant. Cannabis containing significant amounts of CBD was still rare. Police raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana businesses were still common. And because CBD doesn’t get you high, it was easy to miss; hardly anyone outside of pharmaceutical companies and academia had heard of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the nine years since that night in the woods, one of the group’s biggest goals has clearly been accomplished: People know about CBD.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/opinion/24lewis4/merlin_170651910_ce93e3a5-32dd-4c3c-8a14-3e9a5751f199-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nIt has been estimated that the U.S. CBD industry will be worth $16 billion by 2025.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nJennifer Aniston loves beauty products made with it.

And e-commerce sales of CBD\n<a title href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/cbd-e-commerce-sales-are-booming-with-the-world-battling-covid-19-2020-04-06-71975826?mod=mw_quote_news">\nhave grown\n</a>\nthis year amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the CBD landscape of 2020 looks nothing like what the activists and scientists intended. That’s because the federal government’s insistence that cannabis has no legitimate use as a medicine created two enormous problems: the proliferation of fake CBD products and the nonsensical separation of CBD from THC.\n</p>\n<p>\nClinical studies\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16209908">\nhave shown\n</a>\nthat CBD is most effective when paired with at least some THC, even if it is not enough to cause a high. However, the United States considers cannabis with THC to be a Schedule 1 drug — which puts it in the same category as heroin, indicating a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This makes further research very difficult to do, and causes sick people in many states to be treated as criminals.\n</p>\n<p>\nCannabis that is high in CBD but extremely low in THC was made legal at the end of 2018. But finding an easy, affordable test that is able to distinguish cannabis with THC from cannabis without THC has been prohibitively difficult\n<a title href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/02/21/hot-hemp-pits-states-against-feds">\nfor farmers\n</a>\nand\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/cbd-thc-cannabis-cannabidiol.html">\ncrime labs\n</a>\nalike. So federal agencies have been\n<a title href="https://hempindustrydaily.com/fda-cbd-regulation-delay-is-costing-profits-and-shelf-space/">\nslow to regulate\n</a>\nthe booming industry — leading to a deluge of tinctures, smoothies and lotions that trusted tests have shown contain no CBD at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the absence of oversight, the push to get more patients access to cannabis medicine — and bona fide CBD — has been co-opted by a push to make as much money as possible off the next big wellness fad. “At a certain point, it had a life of its own,” Ms. Miller told me.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, the CBD industry promises a miracle drug but is often selling a placebo: cannabidiol products with zero cannabidiol inside. As a result, the compound is often caricatured as snake oil, a scam, even as promising research into the full potential of CBD is starting to pick up.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe compound’s reputation is a microcosm of what it means to be in America right now: a thing that some of us consider a hoax and others praise as the solution to everything. But CBD’s rollicking journey from the international underground to cultural ubiquity proves that, as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAs marijuana use increased in the 1960s and ’70s\n</strong>\n, and the Nixon administration criminalized drugs to vilify what\n<a title href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">\none aide described\n</a>\nas “the antiwar left and black people,” the more science-minded side of the government began funding some basic cannabis research. A man named Carlton Turner helped establish the government’s Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi. After that, he became President Ronald Reagan’s drug czar, helping to\n<a title href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-10-26-8603200589-story.html">\nexpand the War on Drugs\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut all the while, Mr. Turner was in touch with a Brazilian scientist named Elisaldo Carlini who had done\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7028792">\nsmall-scale human studies\n</a>\nshowing CBD reduced seizures: “All the early work on CBD was Carlini in Brazil,” Mr. Turner told me this past summer. “We were in communication for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFor decades, Dr. Carlini’s research was not replicated, in part because so few people had access to the compound: Both the pot held at the nation’s sole government-sanctioned marijuana lab at the University of Mississippi and the illegal pot being smoked around the country had only trace CBD content. (Mr. Turner even tested several kinds of cannabis sent by a legendary pot grower, a writer for “High Times” named Mel Frank. To no avail: none of it contained much CBD.)\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nCarlton Turner helped establish the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nThe University of Mississippi\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nIn those years, emissaries of California’s counterculture were often traveling the world looking for unique strains of cannabis. The most influential of these collectors was a man named David Watson. In the early 70s, Mr. Watson sold his possessions and began hitchhiking from Morocco to India, befriending local pot growers along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Watson ultimately settled in Amsterdam to examine his thousands of kinds of cannabis at his own Dutch state-licensed company, HortaPharm BV. He brought in a friend, an American botanist named Robert Connell Clarke to help. When Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke heard about the CBD research Dr. Carlini had done in Brazil, the pair identified and then bred CBD varietals. This led to a discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It attenuates the high,” Mr. Clarke told me over breakfast in Los Angeles. “That came strictly from anecdotal stoner evidence.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA marijuana plant.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nRobert Connell Clarke was an influential collector of unique strains of cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, after multiple sclerosis patients in England became more vocal about how cannabis helped their symptoms, the country allowed a small pharmaceutical company led by a British physician named\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nDr. Geoffrey Guy\n</a>\nto develop plant-derived cannabis medicines; GW Pharmaceuticals\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nlicensed varietals\n</a>\nbred from Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke’s collection of cannabis and got to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Within a couple of years, they figured out a 1:1 combination of a high-THC chemovar and a high-CBD chemovar presented the greatest latitude of effects and prevention of side effects,” said Dr. Ethan Russo, who worked with GW Pharmaceuticals from 1998 to 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke had discovered, having CBD in the mix reduced THC’s more uncomfortable effects: sedation, inebriation, a faster heart rate. And though a few outliers responded well to CBD alone, GW’s data showed that for relieving pain and inflammation, helping with sleep and alleviating seizures and spasms, most patients got the most benefit from an equal mix of CBD and THC — a drug the company called\n<a title href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-feb-01-me-medpot1-story.html">\nSativex\n</a>\n. But the research wasn’t enough. Although the drug has been approved for use in around 30 countries, the F.D.A. has yet to approve Sativex in the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nMr. Gardner, the writer whose CBD advocacy\n</strong>\neventually inspired the 2011 summit\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA copy of O’Shaughnessy’s, the Journal of Cannabis in Clinical Practice, from 2011.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nFred Gardner in his home on March 2, 2020.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nEnter, three years later, one of Oakland’s pioneering pot entrepreneurs, a medical marijuana impresario with pigtail braids named Steve DeAngelo. Mr. DeAngelo, who had been in contact with Mr. Gardner about the urgent need to institute better testing, agreed to help fund a cannabis analysis lab, Steep Hill, which began its operations in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Gardner came by frequently, chatting and checking in to see if Steep Hill’s founders had discovered the elusive compound. And at last, in February 2009 a dual peak on a testing graph appeared, indicating the presence of CBD.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I remember the moment,” said David Lampach, one of the lab’s funders and co-founders. “Seeing the dual peak and realizing it was real, and running it like five times to make sure.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the summer of 2009, the lab had identified five strains with significant CBD and THC. Mr. Gardner was elated, and began referring to his efforts as “Project CBD” alongside other supporters, including Mr. Lee, the writer. “Right away the thought was: ‘What is the government going to say about this? How can they be against something that’s nonintoxicating?’ ” Mr. Lee said.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June of 2010, the host of the 2011 summit, the biochemist Ms. Miller, opened her own lab, Pure Analytics. A few months later, she called Mr. Ringo, the hippie grower, to let him know a pot sample he sent in was a strain with a lot of CBD — as much as 11 percent.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nContainers of a cannabis flower samples at the Steep Hill lab, which began operations in 2008.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA technician macerating cannabis flower samples at Pure Analytics.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n“He’s in the trim room on speaker, and this big whoop goes up,” she said, remembering his staff’s excitement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 2010, a\n<a title href="https://www.projectcbd.org/">\nProject CBD\n</a>\nwebsite was set up where anyone could look through studies organized by disease or condition. Mr. Lee took charge of running it and it began to attract an audience. A few months later, the network of early CBD advocates met up at Ms. Miller’s house in California to coordinate their evangelism. And by the middle of 2011, word of cannabidiol had permeated the population that would become its most potent promotional engine: the chronically ill, people with cancer, with ALS, with serious disorders that weren’t responding to prescription drugs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs stories about CBD’s power spread, demand increased and prices rose. Sick people often relied on the generosity of growers like Mr. Ringo, his son Dakota told me.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nLawrence Ringo in Blocksburg, Calif., about 2010. He was of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKathleen Hart\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n“I’d go up there and see people dying of cancer hanging out with him, and he’d be hooking them up with oil he made in his house,” the younger Mr. Ringo said. Mike Hyde, whose son was suffering from brain cancer, spent months driving around Colorado and the West Coast looking for CBD in late 2011, before connecting with Mr. Ringo at a restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d never met this guy before, and he brought us literally probably $30,000 worth of oil for this CBD that no one could even get,” Mr. Hyde explained. “For free.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCBD’s big launch into the mainstream came when the world saw evidence of what Dr. Carlini had discovered in Brazil, back in the 1970s: the compound’s ability to quell seizures. Unlike a reduction in pain, this was something any politician or camera crew could easily see. It wasn’t a stoner scam.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, in December 2011, an epileptic child used CBD on the Discovery Channel’s “Weed Wars,” a show featuring the co-founder of the Steep Hill lab, Mr. DeAngelo. The following year, the parents of an epileptic boy in San Francisco\n<a title href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/medical-marijuana-epilepsy/">\nbought\n</a>\nCBD from a pot shop. Then, looking for a better quality product, they contacted GW Pharmaceuticals — the British company that had licensed the cannabis collection of those globe-trotting 20th century cannabis collectors, Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke, and which conducted the research in the ’90s that spurred Mr. Gardner’s CBD advocacy. The\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\ncompany developed\n</a>\na 98 percent CBD drug for the boy and others like him.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteve DeAngelo, a pioneering pot entrepreneur.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\n‘Bubba D’ plants in the Clones &amp; Seeds section of Harborside, one of the first dispensary to laboratory test cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nPerhaps the most critical turning point for CBD came in August 2013, when a CNN special hosted by Dr. Sanjay Gupta profiled a 6-year-old girl in Colorado, Charlotte Figi, who used CBD to treat her epilepsy, as well as the brawny brothers who grew her CBD, the Stanleys. Hundreds of families — witnessing the power of CBD enhanced by cable news production values — moved to Colorado to gain access to the Stanleys’ CBD oil, called Charlotte’s Web. The Stanleys told me their wait-list peaked at 15,000 names. And because of public demand, the F.D.A. fast-tracked clinical trials of GW Pharmaceuticals’ 98 percent CBD drug, Epidiolex.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly, everyone wanted CBD, even though no one quite understood it. In the confusion, there was money to be made. Mere weeks after the CNN documentary aired, the spike in CBD interest prompted the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n<a title href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2013/finra-warns-investors-marijuana-stock-scams">\nto issue an investor alert\n</a>\non marijuana stock scams: As the F.D.A. would\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/warning-letters-and-test-results-cannabidiol-related-products">\nlater show\n</a>\n, many online CBD products contained little or no CBD whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIn 2020, CBD is available three ways:\n</strong>\nover the counter; at state-licensed marijuana dispensaries; or if you have certain forms of epilepsy, from GW Pharmaceuticals. Most Americans encounter CBD in the first and most unreliable way — at, say, a bodega in Brooklyn or a health food store in Indiana. A consultant hired to do an investigation by a corporate chain recently told me that the percentage of over-the-counter CBD products that contained the amount on the label was “in the single digits.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs if CBD’s back story couldn’t get any weirder, the path to this glut of phony CBD was paved by, of all people, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnrelated to the brouhaha on the West Coast, tobacco farmers in Kentucky were seeking a new cash crop. In 2011, James Comer won the race for Kentucky state agriculture commissioner by promising to legalize industrial hemp.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That raised a lot of eyebrows, including in McConnell’s office,” Eric Steenstra, a hemp lobbyist, told me. “They saw the winds were shifting.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlong with Representative Jared Polis, now the governor of Colorado, Mr. McConnell included a hemp pilot program in the 2014 farm bill — for “research.” In the legislation, hemp was defined as cannabis containing\n<a title href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/">\nless than 0.3 percent THC\n</a>\n— an arbitrary threshold, not a scientific distinction: Nothing in the Farm Bill, in case law, or in the Controlled Substances Act seemed to say anything about CBD. So entrepreneurs interpreted this research-oriented pilot program as the de facto legalization of cannabidiol.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration disagreed, but couldn’t stop the tidal wave of CBD production. In 2018,\n<a title href="https://www.kyagr.com/marketing/hemp-overview.html">\nover 60 percent\n</a>\nof the hemp crop in Kentucky was grown for CBD. Then, long after the country was already flooded with CBD products both dubious and legitimate, Mr. McConnell inserted language into the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly making hemp\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process">\nfederally legal\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany of the Californians who plotted at Ms. Miller’s house in 2011 have watched in frustration as the CBD industry flourished, divorced from THC, and fake CBD misled consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn his deathbed in 2014, Mr. Ringo insisted to friends and family that the Stanleys used his seeds to develop their famous strain Charlotte’s Web. Joel Stanley told me the genetics for Charlotte’s Web were a “cross of wild hemp with an industry genetic.” Critics of the Stanley brothers in the cannabis industry have grown annoyed by their prominence and push for patents. Their company has been valued at over half a billion dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller, who still runs a cannabis testing lab, told me that in the years since the 2011 summit, she has become disillusioned as people she’d thought had earnest intentions in spreading CBD turned out to just want to get rich. Mr. Gardner feels the same way.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteep Hill provides cannabis testing services to cultivators, processors, dispensaries, collectives and authorized medical cannabis patients.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nThere has been a slight uptick in clinical research around the compound’s relation to anxiety, schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. In September, the National Institutes of Health\n<a title href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-investigate-minor-cannabinoids-terpenes-potential-pain-relieving-properties">\napproved\n</a>\n$3 million in small grants for studies of cannabidiol and other non-THC cannabis compounds. Nevertheless, the government-enabled ham-handed rush to profiteering has seriously, and unduly, undermined CBD’s medical reputation.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven Dr. Turner, Mr. Reagan’s drug czar, said there is far more evidence for the benefits of Sativex, the half-CBD, half-THC drug, than for unregulated CBD online.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There haven’t been enough clinical trials and there never will be,” said Mr. Clarke, the cannabis seed collector. “There’s no vested financial interest in anyone doing it.” Big Pharma is most invested in medications that they can control, that they alone can patent.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill, some of the states with legal cannabis have implemented robust testing standards, and bona fide CBD can be found at many marijuana dispensaries, both on its own and in a variety of ratios with THC. Ms. Miller’s lab, and other responsible actors, are supposed to ensure products that hit legal pot shop shelves contain exactly what they claim to contain. But without stringent federal oversight, few in the CBD business will voluntarily opt-in to tests of their product labeling’s accuracy.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen I asked Dr. Russo, who oversaw much of GW Pharmaceuticals’ research, how he feels about it all, he sighed. “You do something, and other people run with it, and it turns into something else that you don’t recognize,” he said. “I’m always concerned, but what I like to dwell upon is: What is the real potential here?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Chicago Lewis (\n<a title href="https://twitter.com/msamandalewis">\n@msamandalewis\n</a>\n) is an investigative reporter, focusing on drug policy.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I protect myself while flying?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf air travel is unavoidable,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html">\nthere are some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n</a>\nMost important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public.

Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor.

A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public.

Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor.

We believe that it is critical to move quickly and define such a standard, thereby freeing up researchers to innovate and diversify at the level of higher level algorithms and graph analytics applications. This effort was inspired by the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) of dense Linear Algebra, and hence our working name for this standard is “the GraphBLAS”.\n</p>\n<p>\nA key insight behind this work is that when a graph is represented by a sparse incidence or adjacency matrix, sparse matrix-vector multiplication is a step of breadth first search. By generalizing the pair of scalar operations involved in the linear algebra computations to define a semiring, we can extend the range of these primitives to support a wide range of parallel graph algorithms.\n</p>\n<h1>\n<span>\nMore information\n</span>\n</h1>\n<p>\nA C reference implementation, SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS, can be downloaded from\n<a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur 2013 manifesto for this project can be found\n<a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/PAPERS/GraphPrimitives-HPEC.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe mathematical definition of the GraphBLAS can be found\n<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kepner/GraphBLAS/GraphBLAS-Math-release.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBackground information about graphs in the language of linear algebra can be found in the book:\n<a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/se22/">\nGraph Algorithms in the Language of Linear Algebra\n</a>\n, edited by J.

And it seems less and less likely that the government will be able to focus on grand new designs as opposed to hasty repair jobs. But something else might happen, to spare Mr Johnson’s blushes. Rather than levelling up, Britain could be about to level down, as London sags.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon was not always the great success it is now. After the second world war the government, which had already pinched the capital with a thick Green Belt, deliberately pushed businesses and citizens out to “new towns” in the Home Counties. Manufacturing declined, as did the docks that had once provided jobs and prosperity. By the 1980s the city’s population had fallen by a quarter from the 8.6m it had hit in 1939. London’s schools and services were famously awful.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the Big Bang deregulated financial services in 1986, the logic of agglomeration reasserted itself and London took off. The creative industries and, in recent years, a thriving tech centre have joined the staples of banking, asset management and business services. Schools, policing and transport have all been transformed. People have flooded in from all continents, making London the world’s most global city.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet some warning signs have been visible for a while. Although London’s population has continued to grow, over the last decade that has been driven by international migration and the birth rate. Between 2008 and 2018, 550,000 more Britons left London than moved to it. People complain of high costs and anxiety. One league table in which London scores poorly is the Office for National Statistics’ rankings of well-being and life satisfaction. Since 2015 migration from the capital has helped reduce the differential between London’s house prices and those in the rest of the country (see chart).\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img src="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200523_BRC642.png">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBut London’s house prices remain double those elsewhere. After housing costs are accounted for Londoners are, on average, worse off than residents of the rest of southern England or Scotland. The chairman of\n<small>\nPWC\n</small>\n, a professional-services firm, has argued that graduates are turning their backs on London. Whereas 60% of graduates working for the big four accounting firms used to be based in the capital, in 2018 60% of new starters were outside.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe London office-cost premium is even higher than the housing-cost one. Prime square footage in the capital costs three times as much as space in other southern cities and seven to nine times as much as elsewhere in Britain. According to a legal recruitment firm, a company can save about £20,000 ($24,500) a year by moving a lawyer out of central London, after office costs and salary are taken into account. “Northshoring”—usually referring, confusingly, to places such as Birmingham that are far from northerly—has become something of a buzzword in the industry.\n<small>\nHSBC\n</small>\nchose to move its British retail banking headquarters to Birmingham in 2017. Amazon, an internet retailer, picked Manchester for its major British corporate site in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the coronavirus crushes property values and office rents, London might become a little less offputting. Perhaps some graduates will be tempted back from Leeds or Manchester. But covid-19 and the extreme social-distancing measures used to combat it pose a new and more profound danger to the capital, for they threaten two factors that have been central to its success: fun and foreigners.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon’s triumph is at least partially based on it being a fun place to live. “People come here not only because you can get paid well but because you can have a good time,” says Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy. The bars and cafes of the East End have been an important driver of what Mr McWillams once dubbed the “flat white economy”, where people with interesting hair bounce ideas off each other while drinking trendy beverages.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt is hard to have a flat white economy when you have to maintain two-metre distancing while queuing for your caffeine. Restaurateurs fear that being forced to operate at a lower capacity will drive many of them out of business. Theatres are facing disaster. As a hedge-fund manager puts it, “London without the culture and the restaurants is just a more expensive Frankfurt with more congestion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCovid-19 might combine with Brexit to cut international migration. Although foreign candidates for London jobs will score better on Britain’s new points-based immigration system than those for jobs elsewhere in the country, because the jobs are better paid, the signal has been sent: Britain is not keen on mass immigration. Universities fear that foreign student numbers could fall by 20-50% in the year ahead. For London, with its more than 100,000 foreign students, that is a problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike all great cities, London could also suffer from changing assumptions about work. Many firms now expect that some people will keep working from home even after the danger of coronavirus has receded—if not every day then several days a week. As firms learn to make do with smaller offices, workers might prize bigger homes outside London where they can have an office. The trade-off between space and commuting time looks different if you only have to go in two or three times a week. But if this happens, it will probably benefit commuter towns in the south-east rather than the northern and Midlands towns that Mr Johnson wanted to help.\n</p>\n<p>\nLisa Taylor of Coherent Cities, a consultancy, remains optimistic. “The next two years are going to be very tough,” she argues.“But a different city could emerge on the other side. One where land use has changed, where we have more co-working and co-living spaces.” She reckons that a greener, less congested London could take its inspiration from cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But those are hardly world-beating metropolises.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon is unlikely to slip back into the dismal state it was in before the mid-1980s. It is likely to remain richer and more productive than the rest of Britain. It will remain Europe’s most powerful magnet for talented immigrants. Still, its pulling power is likely to wane. If that happens, Britain’s economy will probably suffer. But a less centralised country, in which opportunity was more evenly distributed, might be a better place in other ways.\n<span>\n■\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\nEditor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of\n</em>\nThe Economist Today\n<em>\n, our daily\n<a href="https://my.economist.com/user#newsletter">\nnewsletter\n</a>\n.

They sat in a circle at a house in the hills a few hours north of San Francisco — where wine country becomes weed country — to discuss the therapeutic potential of CBD, and how to get people to take it seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeveral studies in rodents and in cell cultures had\n<a title href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462008000300015&lng=en&tlng=en">\nsuggested\n</a>\nthat CBD, a nonintoxicating compound from the cannabis plant more formally known as cannabidiol, could protect the nervous system, modulate blood flow, slow the growth of cancer cells and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We were talking about, ‘What can we do with this?’ ” recalled Samantha Miller, who hosted the event at her split-level house, wedged between redwoods and a creek below. A headstrong biochemist, she had been growing marijuana since the age of 14 and had just quit a six-figure job to start her own cannabis testing lab\n<strong>\n.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSamantha Miller at her home in northern California.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA ragtag crew of activists, doctors, writers and marijuana farmers met to discuss the potential of CBD in 2011 at Samantha Miller’s home.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nAfter two years of tracking down high-CBD pot plants and building momentum, the group began to devise ways to persuade more farmers to grow strains with CBD — which had largely been bred out of American pot since it doesn’t get you high. In addition to convincing marijuana dispensaries to widely carry CBD, they wanted to educate the public about its promising benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the group of ten or so brainstormed, a balloon of vaporized pot was passed in one direction and a bong in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There was a strong sense that this was really going to be something, if when people use these strains they have any kind of experience like the mice did in the laboratories,” said Martin Lee, a writer who at the time had been finishing a book\n<a title href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Smoke_Signals.html?id=8XE-AAAAQBAJ">\nabout the social history of marijuana\n</a>\nfor Simon &amp; Schuster.\n</p>\n<p>\nNear him was Stacey Kerr, a physician with flowing silver hair who served as treasurer of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, as well as Wade Laughter, a soft-spoken man in glasses who had started cultivating pot for his glaucoma in the mid-90s. Mr. Laughter and Lawrence Ringo, an old-school hippie grower, were some of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC — the compound that does get you high. Both pledged to keep their strains available for other growers at cheap prices. (Mr. Ringo said he would sell his seeds for as little as $5.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, there was Fred Gardner, a writer who had recruited almost all of these people to the CBD cause. A Harvard-educated former antiwar activist, now 78, Mr. Gardner had been writing about CBD since the late 1990s for publications like Synapse,\n<a title href="https://synapse.library.ucsf.edu/?a=d&d=ucsf19990701-01.2.4&srpos=2&e=-------en--20--1--txt-fred+gardner+gw-----txIN--">\nthe U.C. San Francisco weekly\n</a>\n. For years, he’d been determined to connect the nascent CBD research he heard about at symposiums abroad with the medical marijuana movement in California. And with this group, finally, it seemed to be coming together.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller spent the months after this meeting leading hundreds of CBD seminars for farmers; Dr. Kerr began informal patient surveys to track how CBD made people feel; and as he finished his book, Mr. Lee often traveled around with Mr. Laughter and Mr. Ringo’s high-CBD plants and seeds, spreading the gospel at pot shops across the West.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was aware that this was a pretty special moment,” Dr. Kerr told me, talking about the night at Ms. Miller’s. “That it was the beginning of something big, and we were there to see it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAt the time of Samantha Miller’s summit in 2011\n</strong>\n, THC was the sole chemical “face” of the plant. Cannabis containing significant amounts of CBD was still rare. Police raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana businesses were still common. And because CBD doesn’t get you high, it was easy to miss; hardly anyone outside of pharmaceutical companies and academia had heard of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the nine years since that night in the woods, one of the group’s biggest goals has clearly been accomplished: People know about CBD.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/opinion/24lewis4/merlin_170651910_ce93e3a5-32dd-4c3c-8a14-3e9a5751f199-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nIt has been estimated that the U.S. CBD industry will be worth $16 billion by 2025.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nJennifer Aniston loves beauty products made with it.

That’s because the federal government’s insistence that cannabis has no legitimate use as a medicine created two enormous problems: the proliferation of fake CBD products and the nonsensical separation of CBD from THC.\n</p>\n<p>\nClinical studies\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16209908">\nhave shown\n</a>\nthat CBD is most effective when paired with at least some THC, even if it is not enough to cause a high. However, the United States considers cannabis with THC to be a Schedule 1 drug — which puts it in the same category as heroin, indicating a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This makes further research very difficult to do, and causes sick people in many states to be treated as criminals.\n</p>\n<p>\nCannabis that is high in CBD but extremely low in THC was made legal at the end of 2018. But finding an easy, affordable test that is able to distinguish cannabis with THC from cannabis without THC has been prohibitively difficult\n<a title href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/02/21/hot-hemp-pits-states-against-feds">\nfor farmers\n</a>\nand\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/cbd-thc-cannabis-cannabidiol.html">\ncrime labs\n</a>\nalike. So federal agencies have been\n<a title href="https://hempindustrydaily.com/fda-cbd-regulation-delay-is-costing-profits-and-shelf-space/">\nslow to regulate\n</a>\nthe booming industry — leading to a deluge of tinctures, smoothies and lotions that trusted tests have shown contain no CBD at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the absence of oversight, the push to get more patients access to cannabis medicine — and bona fide CBD — has been co-opted by a push to make as much money as possible off the next big wellness fad. “At a certain point, it had a life of its own,” Ms. Miller told me.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, the CBD industry promises a miracle drug but is often selling a placebo: cannabidiol products with zero cannabidiol inside. As a result, the compound is often caricatured as snake oil, a scam, even as promising research into the full potential of CBD is starting to pick up.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe compound’s reputation is a microcosm of what it means to be in America right now: a thing that some of us consider a hoax and others praise as the solution to everything. But CBD’s rollicking journey from the international underground to cultural ubiquity proves that, as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAs marijuana use increased in the 1960s and ’70s\n</strong>\n, and the Nixon administration criminalized drugs to vilify what\n<a title href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">\none aide described\n</a>\nas “the antiwar left and black people,” the more science-minded side of the government began funding some basic cannabis research. A man named Carlton Turner helped establish the government’s Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi. After that, he became President Ronald Reagan’s drug czar, helping to\n<a title href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-10-26-8603200589-story.html">\nexpand the War on Drugs\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut all the while, Mr. Turner was in touch with a Brazilian scientist named Elisaldo Carlini who had done\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7028792">\nsmall-scale human studies\n</a>\nshowing CBD reduced seizures: “All the early work on CBD was Carlini in Brazil,” Mr. Turner told me this past summer. “We were in communication for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFor decades, Dr. Carlini’s research was not replicated, in part because so few people had access to the compound: Both the pot held at the nation’s sole government-sanctioned marijuana lab at the University of Mississippi and the illegal pot being smoked around the country had only trace CBD content. (Mr. Turner even tested several kinds of cannabis sent by a legendary pot grower, a writer for “High Times” named Mel Frank. To no avail: none of it contained much CBD.)\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nCarlton Turner helped establish the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nThe University of Mississippi\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nIn those years, emissaries of California’s counterculture were often traveling the world looking for unique strains of cannabis. The most influential of these collectors was a man named David Watson. In the early 70s, Mr. Watson sold his possessions and began hitchhiking from Morocco to India, befriending local pot growers along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Watson ultimately settled in Amsterdam to examine his thousands of kinds of cannabis at his own Dutch state-licensed company, HortaPharm BV. He brought in a friend, an American botanist named Robert Connell Clarke to help. When Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke heard about the CBD research Dr. Carlini had done in Brazil, the pair identified and then bred CBD varietals. This led to a discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It attenuates the high,” Mr. Clarke told me over breakfast in Los Angeles. “That came strictly from anecdotal stoner evidence.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA marijuana plant.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nRobert Connell Clarke was an influential collector of unique strains of cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, after multiple sclerosis patients in England became more vocal about how cannabis helped their symptoms, the country allowed a small pharmaceutical company led by a British physician named\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nDr. Geoffrey Guy\n</a>\nto develop plant-derived cannabis medicines; GW Pharmaceuticals\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nlicensed varietals\n</a>\nbred from Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke’s collection of cannabis and got to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Within a couple of years, they figured out a 1:1 combination of a high-THC chemovar and a high-CBD chemovar presented the greatest latitude of effects and prevention of side effects,” said Dr. Ethan Russo, who worked with GW Pharmaceuticals from 1998 to 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke had discovered, having CBD in the mix reduced THC’s more uncomfortable effects: sedation, inebriation, a faster heart rate. And though a few outliers responded well to CBD alone, GW’s data showed that for relieving pain and inflammation, helping with sleep and alleviating seizures and spasms, most patients got the most benefit from an equal mix of CBD and THC — a drug the company called\n<a title href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-feb-01-me-medpot1-story.html">\nSativex\n</a>\n. But the research wasn’t enough. Although the drug has been approved for use in around 30 countries, the F.D.A. has yet to approve Sativex in the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nMr. Gardner, the writer whose CBD advocacy\n</strong>\neventually inspired the 2011 summit\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA copy of O’Shaughnessy’s, the Journal of Cannabis in Clinical Practice, from 2011.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nFred Gardner in his home on March 2, 2020.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nEnter, three years later, one of Oakland’s pioneering pot entrepreneurs, a medical marijuana impresario with pigtail braids named Steve DeAngelo. Mr. DeAngelo, who had been in contact with Mr. Gardner about the urgent need to institute better testing, agreed to help fund a cannabis analysis lab, Steep Hill, which began its operations in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Gardner came by frequently, chatting and checking in to see if Steep Hill’s founders had discovered the elusive compound. And at last, in February 2009 a dual peak on a testing graph appeared, indicating the presence of CBD.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I remember the moment,” said David Lampach, one of the lab’s funders and co-founders. “Seeing the dual peak and realizing it was real, and running it like five times to make sure.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the summer of 2009, the lab had identified five strains with significant CBD and THC. Mr. Gardner was elated, and began referring to his efforts as “Project CBD” alongside other supporters, including Mr. Lee, the writer. “Right away the thought was: ‘What is the government going to say about this? How can they be against something that’s nonintoxicating?’ ” Mr. Lee said.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June of 2010, the host of the 2011 summit, the biochemist Ms. Miller, opened her own lab, Pure Analytics. A few months later, she called Mr. Ringo, the hippie grower, to let him know a pot sample he sent in was a strain with a lot of CBD — as much as 11 percent.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nContainers of a cannabis flower samples at the Steep Hill lab, which began operations in 2008.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA technician macerating cannabis flower samples at Pure Analytics.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n“He’s in the trim room on speaker, and this big whoop goes up,” she said, remembering his staff’s excitement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 2010, a\n<a title href="https://www.projectcbd.org/">\nProject CBD\n</a>\nwebsite was set up where anyone could look through studies organized by disease or condition. Mr. Lee took charge of running it and it began to attract an audience. A few months later, the network of early CBD advocates met up at Ms. Miller’s house in California to coordinate their evangelism. And by the middle of 2011, word of cannabidiol had permeated the population that would become its most potent promotional engine: the chronically ill, people with cancer, with ALS, with serious disorders that weren’t responding to prescription drugs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs stories about CBD’s power spread, demand increased and prices rose. Sick people often relied on the generosity of growers like Mr. Ringo, his son Dakota told me.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nLawrence Ringo in Blocksburg, Calif., about 2010. He was of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKathleen Hart\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n“I’d go up there and see people dying of cancer hanging out with him, and he’d be hooking them up with oil he made in his house,” the younger Mr. Ringo said. Mike Hyde, whose son was suffering from brain cancer, spent months driving around Colorado and the West Coast looking for CBD in late 2011, before connecting with Mr. Ringo at a restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d never met this guy before, and he brought us literally probably $30,000 worth of oil for this CBD that no one could even get,” Mr. Hyde explained. “For free.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCBD’s big launch into the mainstream came when the world saw evidence of what Dr. Carlini had discovered in Brazil, back in the 1970s: the compound’s ability to quell seizures. Unlike a reduction in pain, this was something any politician or camera crew could easily see. It wasn’t a stoner scam.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, in December 2011, an epileptic child used CBD on the Discovery Channel’s “Weed Wars,” a show featuring the co-founder of the Steep Hill lab, Mr. DeAngelo. The following year, the parents of an epileptic boy in San Francisco\n<a title href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/medical-marijuana-epilepsy/">\nbought\n</a>\nCBD from a pot shop. Then, looking for a better quality product, they contacted GW Pharmaceuticals — the British company that had licensed the cannabis collection of those globe-trotting 20th century cannabis collectors, Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke, and which conducted the research in the ’90s that spurred Mr. Gardner’s CBD advocacy. The\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\ncompany developed\n</a>\na 98 percent CBD drug for the boy and others like him.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteve DeAngelo, a pioneering pot entrepreneur.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\n‘Bubba D’ plants in the Clones &amp; Seeds section of Harborside, one of the first dispensary to laboratory test cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nPerhaps the most critical turning point for CBD came in August 2013, when a CNN special hosted by Dr. Sanjay Gupta profiled a 6-year-old girl in Colorado, Charlotte Figi, who used CBD to treat her epilepsy, as well as the brawny brothers who grew her CBD, the Stanleys. Hundreds of families — witnessing the power of CBD enhanced by cable news production values — moved to Colorado to gain access to the Stanleys’ CBD oil, called Charlotte’s Web. The Stanleys told me their wait-list peaked at 15,000 names. And because of public demand, the F.D.A. fast-tracked clinical trials of GW Pharmaceuticals’ 98 percent CBD drug, Epidiolex.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly, everyone wanted CBD, even though no one quite understood it. In the confusion, there was money to be made. Mere weeks after the CNN documentary aired, the spike in CBD interest prompted the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n<a title href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2013/finra-warns-investors-marijuana-stock-scams">\nto issue an investor alert\n</a>\non marijuana stock scams: As the F.D.A. would\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/warning-letters-and-test-results-cannabidiol-related-products">\nlater show\n</a>\n, many online CBD products contained little or no CBD whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIn 2020, CBD is available three ways:\n</strong>\nover the counter; at state-licensed marijuana dispensaries; or if you have certain forms of epilepsy, from GW Pharmaceuticals. Most Americans encounter CBD in the first and most unreliable way — at, say, a bodega in Brooklyn or a health food store in Indiana. A consultant hired to do an investigation by a corporate chain recently told me that the percentage of over-the-counter CBD products that contained the amount on the label was “in the single digits.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs if CBD’s back story couldn’t get any weirder, the path to this glut of phony CBD was paved by, of all people, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnrelated to the brouhaha on the West Coast, tobacco farmers in Kentucky were seeking a new cash crop. In 2011, James Comer won the race for Kentucky state agriculture commissioner by promising to legalize industrial hemp.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That raised a lot of eyebrows, including in McConnell’s office,” Eric Steenstra, a hemp lobbyist, told me. “They saw the winds were shifting.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlong with Representative Jared Polis, now the governor of Colorado, Mr. McConnell included a hemp pilot program in the 2014 farm bill — for “research.” In the legislation, hemp was defined as cannabis containing\n<a title href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/">\nless than 0.3 percent THC\n</a>\n— an arbitrary threshold, not a scientific distinction: Nothing in the Farm Bill, in case law, or in the Controlled Substances Act seemed to say anything about CBD. So entrepreneurs interpreted this research-oriented pilot program as the de facto legalization of cannabidiol.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration disagreed, but couldn’t stop the tidal wave of CBD production. In 2018,\n<a title href="https://www.kyagr.com/marketing/hemp-overview.html">\nover 60 percent\n</a>\nof the hemp crop in Kentucky was grown for CBD. Then, long after the country was already flooded with CBD products both dubious and legitimate, Mr. McConnell inserted language into the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly making hemp\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process">\nfederally legal\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany of the Californians who plotted at Ms. Miller’s house in 2011 have watched in frustration as the CBD industry flourished, divorced from THC, and fake CBD misled consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn his deathbed in 2014, Mr. Ringo insisted to friends and family that the Stanleys used his seeds to develop their famous strain Charlotte’s Web. Joel Stanley told me the genetics for Charlotte’s Web were a “cross of wild hemp with an industry genetic.” Critics of the Stanley brothers in the cannabis industry have grown annoyed by their prominence and push for patents. Their company has been valued at over half a billion dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller, who still runs a cannabis testing lab, told me that in the years since the 2011 summit, she has become disillusioned as people she’d thought had earnest intentions in spreading CBD turned out to just want to get rich. Mr. Gardner feels the same way.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteep Hill provides cannabis testing services to cultivators, processors, dispensaries, collectives and authorized medical cannabis patients.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nThere has been a slight uptick in clinical research around the compound’s relation to anxiety, schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. In September, the National Institutes of Health\n<a title href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-investigate-minor-cannabinoids-terpenes-potential-pain-relieving-properties">\napproved\n</a>\n$3 million in small grants for studies of cannabidiol and other non-THC cannabis compounds. Nevertheless, the government-enabled ham-handed rush to profiteering has seriously, and unduly, undermined CBD’s medical reputation.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven Dr. Turner, Mr. Reagan’s drug czar, said there is far more evidence for the benefits of Sativex, the half-CBD, half-THC drug, than for unregulated CBD online.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There haven’t been enough clinical trials and there never will be,” said Mr. Clarke, the cannabis seed collector. “There’s no vested financial interest in anyone doing it.” Big Pharma is most invested in medications that they can control, that they alone can patent.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill, some of the states with legal cannabis have implemented robust testing standards, and bona fide CBD can be found at many marijuana dispensaries, both on its own and in a variety of ratios with THC. Ms. Miller’s lab, and other responsible actors, are supposed to ensure products that hit legal pot shop shelves contain exactly what they claim to contain. But without stringent federal oversight, few in the CBD business will voluntarily opt-in to tests of their product labeling’s accuracy.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen I asked Dr. Russo, who oversaw much of GW Pharmaceuticals’ research, how he feels about it all, he sighed. “You do something, and other people run with it, and it turns into something else that you don’t recognize,” he said. “I’m always concerned, but what I like to dwell upon is: What is the real potential here?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Chicago Lewis (\n<a title href="https://twitter.com/msamandalewis">\n@msamandalewis\n</a>\n) is an investigative reporter, focusing on drug policy.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I protect myself while flying?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf air travel is unavoidable,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html">\nthere are some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n</a>\nMost important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html">\nnew concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms\n</a>\n. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor.

Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I help?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=7779">\nCharity Navigator\n</a>\n, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I protect myself while flying?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf air travel is unavoidable,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html">\nthere are some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n</a>\nMost important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html">\nnew concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms\n</a>\n. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I get tested?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nthe C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears.\n</a>\nThey will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I help?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=7779">\nCharity Navigator\n</a>\n, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak.

We believe that it is critical to move quickly and define such a standard, thereby freeing up researchers to innovate and diversify at the level of higher level algorithms and graph analytics applications. This effort was inspired by the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) of dense Linear Algebra, and hence our working name for this standard is “the GraphBLAS”.\n</p>\n<p>\nA key insight behind this work is that when a graph is represented by a sparse incidence or adjacency matrix, sparse matrix-vector multiplication is a step of breadth first search.

Poor parts of the Midlands and north of England would get lots of infrastructure investment, helping them to close the productivity gap with London. The country would be “levelled up”.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe idea always seemed a little far-fetched. British governments have been trying to boost productivity outside London for decades, with not much success. And it seems less and less likely that the government will be able to focus on grand new designs as opposed to hasty repair jobs. But something else might happen, to spare Mr Johnson’s blushes. Rather than levelling up, Britain could be about to level down, as London sags.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon was not always the great success it is now. After the second world war the government, which had already pinched the capital with a thick Green Belt, deliberately pushed businesses and citizens out to “new towns” in the Home Counties. Manufacturing declined, as did the docks that had once provided jobs and prosperity. By the 1980s the city’s population had fallen by a quarter from the 8.6m it had hit in 1939. London’s schools and services were famously awful.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the Big Bang deregulated financial services in 1986, the logic of agglomeration reasserted itself and London took off. The creative industries and, in recent years, a thriving tech centre have joined the staples of banking, asset management and business services. Schools, policing and transport have all been transformed. People have flooded in from all continents, making London the world’s most global city.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet some warning signs have been visible for a while. Although London’s population has continued to grow, over the last decade that has been driven by international migration and the birth rate. Between 2008 and 2018, 550,000 more Britons left London than moved to it. People complain of high costs and anxiety. One league table in which London scores poorly is the Office for National Statistics’ rankings of well-being and life satisfaction. Since 2015 migration from the capital has helped reduce the differential between London’s house prices and those in the rest of the country (see chart).\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img src="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200523_BRC642.png">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBut London’s house prices remain double those elsewhere. After housing costs are accounted for Londoners are, on average, worse off than residents of the rest of southern England or Scotland. The chairman of\n<small>\nPWC\n</small>\n, a professional-services firm, has argued that graduates are turning their backs on London. Whereas 60% of graduates working for the big four accounting firms used to be based in the capital, in 2018 60% of new starters were outside.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe London office-cost premium is even higher than the housing-cost one. Prime square footage in the capital costs three times as much as space in other southern cities and seven to nine times as much as elsewhere in Britain. According to a legal recruitment firm, a company can save about £20,000 ($24,500) a year by moving a lawyer out of central London, after office costs and salary are taken into account. “Northshoring”—usually referring, confusingly, to places such as Birmingham that are far from northerly—has become something of a buzzword in the industry.\n<small>\nHSBC\n</small>\nchose to move its British retail banking headquarters to Birmingham in 2017. Amazon, an internet retailer, picked Manchester for its major British corporate site in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the coronavirus crushes property values and office rents, London might become a little less offputting. Perhaps some graduates will be tempted back from Leeds or Manchester. But covid-19 and the extreme social-distancing measures used to combat it pose a new and more profound danger to the capital, for they threaten two factors that have been central to its success: fun and foreigners.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon’s triumph is at least partially based on it being a fun place to live. “People come here not only because you can get paid well but because you can have a good time,” says Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy. The bars and cafes of the East End have been an important driver of what Mr McWillams once dubbed the “flat white economy”, where people with interesting hair bounce ideas off each other while drinking trendy beverages.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt is hard to have a flat white economy when you have to maintain two-metre distancing while queuing for your caffeine. Restaurateurs fear that being forced to operate at a lower capacity will drive many of them out of business. Theatres are facing disaster. As a hedge-fund manager puts it, “London without the culture and the restaurants is just a more expensive Frankfurt with more congestion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCovid-19 might combine with Brexit to cut international migration. Although foreign candidates for London jobs will score better on Britain’s new points-based immigration system than those for jobs elsewhere in the country, because the jobs are better paid, the signal has been sent: Britain is not keen on mass immigration. Universities fear that foreign student numbers could fall by 20-50% in the year ahead. For London, with its more than 100,000 foreign students, that is a problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike all great cities, London could also suffer from changing assumptions about work. Many firms now expect that some people will keep working from home even after the danger of coronavirus has receded—if not every day then several days a week. As firms learn to make do with smaller offices, workers might prize bigger homes outside London where they can have an office. The trade-off between space and commuting time looks different if you only have to go in two or three times a week. But if this happens, it will probably benefit commuter towns in the south-east rather than the northern and Midlands towns that Mr Johnson wanted to help.\n</p>\n<p>\nLisa Taylor of Coherent Cities, a consultancy, remains optimistic. “The next two years are going to be very tough,” she argues.“But a different city could emerge on the other side. One where land use has changed, where we have more co-working and co-living spaces.” She reckons that a greener, less congested London could take its inspiration from cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But those are hardly world-beating metropolises.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon is unlikely to slip back into the dismal state it was in before the mid-1980s. It is likely to remain richer and more productive than the rest of Britain. It will remain Europe’s most powerful magnet for talented immigrants. Still, its pulling power is likely to wane. If that happens, Britain’s economy will probably suffer. But a less centralised country, in which opportunity was more evenly distributed, might be a better place in other ways.\n<span>\n■\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\nEditor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of\n</em>\nThe Economist Today\n<em>\n, our daily\n<a href="https://my.economist.com/user#newsletter">\nnewsletter\n</a>\n.

They sat in a circle at a house in the hills a few hours north of San Francisco — where wine country becomes weed country — to discuss the therapeutic potential of CBD, and how to get people to take it seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeveral studies in rodents and in cell cultures had\n<a title href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462008000300015&lng=en&tlng=en">\nsuggested\n</a>\nthat CBD, a nonintoxicating compound from the cannabis plant more formally known as cannabidiol, could protect the nervous system, modulate blood flow, slow the growth of cancer cells and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We were talking about, ‘What can we do with this?’ ” recalled Samantha Miller, who hosted the event at her split-level house, wedged between redwoods and a creek below. A headstrong biochemist, she had been growing marijuana since the age of 14 and had just quit a six-figure job to start her own cannabis testing lab\n<strong>\n.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSamantha Miller at her home in northern California.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA ragtag crew of activists, doctors, writers and marijuana farmers met to discuss the potential of CBD in 2011 at Samantha Miller’s home.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nAfter two years of tracking down high-CBD pot plants and building momentum, the group began to devise ways to persuade more farmers to grow strains with CBD — which had largely been bred out of American pot since it doesn’t get you high. In addition to convincing marijuana dispensaries to widely carry CBD, they wanted to educate the public about its promising benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the group of ten or so brainstormed, a balloon of vaporized pot was passed in one direction and a bong in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There was a strong sense that this was really going to be something, if when people use these strains they have any kind of experience like the mice did in the laboratories,” said Martin Lee, a writer who at the time had been finishing a book\n<a title href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Smoke_Signals.html?id=8XE-AAAAQBAJ">\nabout the social history of marijuana\n</a>\nfor Simon &amp; Schuster.\n</p>\n<p>\nNear him was Stacey Kerr, a physician with flowing silver hair who served as treasurer of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, as well as Wade Laughter, a soft-spoken man in glasses who had started cultivating pot for his glaucoma in the mid-90s. Mr. Laughter and Lawrence Ringo, an old-school hippie grower, were some of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC — the compound that does get you high. Both pledged to keep their strains available for other growers at cheap prices. (Mr. Ringo said he would sell his seeds for as little as $5.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, there was Fred Gardner, a writer who had recruited almost all of these people to the CBD cause. A Harvard-educated former antiwar activist, now 78, Mr. Gardner had been writing about CBD since the late 1990s for publications like Synapse,\n<a title href="https://synapse.library.ucsf.edu/?a=d&d=ucsf19990701-01.2.4&srpos=2&e=-------en--20--1--txt-fred+gardner+gw-----txIN--">\nthe U.C. San Francisco weekly\n</a>\n. For years, he’d been determined to connect the nascent CBD research he heard about at symposiums abroad with the medical marijuana movement in California. And with this group, finally, it seemed to be coming together.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller spent the months after this meeting leading hundreds of CBD seminars for farmers; Dr. Kerr began informal patient surveys to track how CBD made people feel; and as he finished his book, Mr. Lee often traveled around with Mr. Laughter and Mr. Ringo’s high-CBD plants and seeds, spreading the gospel at pot shops across the West.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was aware that this was a pretty special moment,” Dr. Kerr told me, talking about the night at Ms. Miller’s. “That it was the beginning of something big, and we were there to see it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAt the time of Samantha Miller’s summit in 2011\n</strong>\n, THC was the sole chemical “face” of the plant. Cannabis containing significant amounts of CBD was still rare. Police raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana businesses were still common. And because CBD doesn’t get you high, it was easy to miss; hardly anyone outside of pharmaceutical companies and academia had heard of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the nine years since that night in the woods, one of the group’s biggest goals has clearly been accomplished: People know about CBD.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/opinion/24lewis4/merlin_170651910_ce93e3a5-32dd-4c3c-8a14-3e9a5751f199-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nIt has been estimated that the U.S. CBD industry will be worth $16 billion by 2025.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nJennifer Aniston loves beauty products made with it.

That’s because the federal government’s insistence that cannabis has no legitimate use as a medicine created two enormous problems: the proliferation of fake CBD products and the nonsensical separation of CBD from THC.\n</p>\n<p>\nClinical studies\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16209908">\nhave shown\n</a>\nthat CBD is most effective when paired with at least some THC, even if it is not enough to cause a high. However, the United States considers cannabis with THC to be a Schedule 1 drug — which puts it in the same category as heroin, indicating a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This makes further research very difficult to do, and causes sick people in many states to be treated as criminals.\n</p>\n<p>\nCannabis that is high in CBD but extremely low in THC was made legal at the end of 2018. But finding an easy, affordable test that is able to distinguish cannabis with THC from cannabis without THC has been prohibitively difficult\n<a title href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/02/21/hot-hemp-pits-states-against-feds">\nfor farmers\n</a>\nand\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/cbd-thc-cannabis-cannabidiol.html">\ncrime labs\n</a>\nalike. So federal agencies have been\n<a title href="https://hempindustrydaily.com/fda-cbd-regulation-delay-is-costing-profits-and-shelf-space/">\nslow to regulate\n</a>\nthe booming industry — leading to a deluge of tinctures, smoothies and lotions that trusted tests have shown contain no CBD at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the absence of oversight, the push to get more patients access to cannabis medicine — and bona fide CBD — has been co-opted by a push to make as much money as possible off the next big wellness fad. “At a certain point, it had a life of its own,” Ms. Miller told me.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, the CBD industry promises a miracle drug but is often selling a placebo: cannabidiol products with zero cannabidiol inside. As a result, the compound is often caricatured as snake oil, a scam, even as promising research into the full potential of CBD is starting to pick up.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe compound’s reputation is a microcosm of what it means to be in America right now: a thing that some of us consider a hoax and others praise as the solution to everything. But CBD’s rollicking journey from the international underground to cultural ubiquity proves that, as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAs marijuana use increased in the 1960s and ’70s\n</strong>\n, and the Nixon administration criminalized drugs to vilify what\n<a title href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">\none aide described\n</a>\nas “the antiwar left and black people,” the more science-minded side of the government began funding some basic cannabis research. A man named Carlton Turner helped establish the government’s Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi. After that, he became President Ronald Reagan’s drug czar, helping to\n<a title href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-10-26-8603200589-story.html">\nexpand the War on Drugs\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut all the while, Mr. Turner was in touch with a Brazilian scientist named Elisaldo Carlini who had done\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7028792">\nsmall-scale human studies\n</a>\nshowing CBD reduced seizures: “All the early work on CBD was Carlini in Brazil,” Mr. Turner told me this past summer. “We were in communication for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFor decades, Dr. Carlini’s research was not replicated, in part because so few people had access to the compound: Both the pot held at the nation’s sole government-sanctioned marijuana lab at the University of Mississippi and the illegal pot being smoked around the country had only trace CBD content. (Mr. Turner even tested several kinds of cannabis sent by a legendary pot grower, a writer for “High Times” named Mel Frank. To no avail: none of it contained much CBD.)\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nCarlton Turner helped establish the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nThe University of Mississippi\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nIn those years, emissaries of California’s counterculture were often traveling the world looking for unique strains of cannabis. The most influential of these collectors was a man named David Watson. In the early 70s, Mr. Watson sold his possessions and began hitchhiking from Morocco to India, befriending local pot growers along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Watson ultimately settled in Amsterdam to examine his thousands of kinds of cannabis at his own Dutch state-licensed company, HortaPharm BV. He brought in a friend, an American botanist named Robert Connell Clarke to help. When Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke heard about the CBD research Dr. Carlini had done in Brazil, the pair identified and then bred CBD varietals. This led to a discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It attenuates the high,” Mr. Clarke told me over breakfast in Los Angeles. “That came strictly from anecdotal stoner evidence.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA marijuana plant.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nRobert Connell Clarke was an influential collector of unique strains of cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, after multiple sclerosis patients in England became more vocal about how cannabis helped their symptoms, the country allowed a small pharmaceutical company led by a British physician named\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nDr. Geoffrey Guy\n</a>\nto develop plant-derived cannabis medicines; GW Pharmaceuticals\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nlicensed varietals\n</a>\nbred from Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke’s collection of cannabis and got to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Within a couple of years, they figured out a 1:1 combination of a high-THC chemovar and a high-CBD chemovar presented the greatest latitude of effects and prevention of side effects,” said Dr. Ethan Russo, who worked with GW Pharmaceuticals from 1998 to 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke had discovered, having CBD in the mix reduced THC’s more uncomfortable effects: sedation, inebriation, a faster heart rate. And though a few outliers responded well to CBD alone, GW’s data showed that for relieving pain and inflammation, helping with sleep and alleviating seizures and spasms, most patients got the most benefit from an equal mix of CBD and THC — a drug the company called\n<a title href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-feb-01-me-medpot1-story.html">\nSativex\n</a>\n. But the research wasn’t enough.

Mr. DeAngelo, who had been in contact with Mr. Gardner about the urgent need to institute better testing, agreed to help fund a cannabis analysis lab, Steep Hill, which began its operations in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Gardner came by frequently, chatting and checking in to see if Steep Hill’s founders had discovered the elusive compound. And at last, in February 2009 a dual peak on a testing graph appeared, indicating the presence of CBD.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I remember the moment,” said David Lampach, one of the lab’s funders and co-founders. “Seeing the dual peak and realizing it was real, and running it like five times to make sure.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the summer of 2009, the lab had identified five strains with significant CBD and THC. Mr. Gardner was elated, and began referring to his efforts as “Project CBD” alongside other supporters, including Mr. Lee, the writer. “Right away the thought was: ‘What is the government going to say about this? How can they be against something that’s nonintoxicating?’ ” Mr. Lee said.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June of 2010, the host of the 2011 summit, the biochemist Ms. Miller, opened her own lab, Pure Analytics. A few months later, she called Mr. Ringo, the hippie grower, to let him know a pot sample he sent in was a strain with a lot of CBD — as much as 11 percent.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nContainers of a cannabis flower samples at the Steep Hill lab, which began operations in 2008.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA technician macerating cannabis flower samples at Pure Analytics.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n“He’s in the trim room on speaker, and this big whoop goes up,” she said, remembering his staff’s excitement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 2010, a\n<a title href="https://www.projectcbd.org/">\nProject CBD\n</a>\nwebsite was set up where anyone could look through studies organized by disease or condition. Mr. Lee took charge of running it and it began to attract an audience. A few months later, the network of early CBD advocates met up at Ms. Miller’s house in California to coordinate their evangelism. And by the middle of 2011, word of cannabidiol had permeated the population that would become its most potent promotional engine: the chronically ill, people with cancer, with ALS, with serious disorders that weren’t responding to prescription drugs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs stories about CBD’s power spread, demand increased and prices rose. Sick people often relied on the generosity of growers like Mr. Ringo, his son Dakota told me.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nLawrence Ringo in Blocksburg, Calif., about 2010. He was of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKathleen Hart\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n“I’d go up there and see people dying of cancer hanging out with him, and he’d be hooking them up with oil he made in his house,” the younger Mr. Ringo said. Mike Hyde, whose son was suffering from brain cancer, spent months driving around Colorado and the West Coast looking for CBD in late 2011, before connecting with Mr. Ringo at a restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d never met this guy before, and he brought us literally probably $30,000 worth of oil for this CBD that no one could even get,” Mr. Hyde explained. “For free.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCBD’s big launch into the mainstream came when the world saw evidence of what Dr. Carlini had discovered in Brazil, back in the 1970s: the compound’s ability to quell seizures. Unlike a reduction in pain, this was something any politician or camera crew could easily see. It wasn’t a stoner scam.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, in December 2011, an epileptic child used CBD on the Discovery Channel’s “Weed Wars,” a show featuring the co-founder of the Steep Hill lab, Mr. DeAngelo. The following year, the parents of an epileptic boy in San Francisco\n<a title href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/medical-marijuana-epilepsy/">\nbought\n</a>\nCBD from a pot shop. Then, looking for a better quality product, they contacted GW Pharmaceuticals — the British company that had licensed the cannabis collection of those globe-trotting 20th century cannabis collectors, Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke, and which conducted the research in the ’90s that spurred Mr. Gardner’s CBD advocacy. The\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\ncompany developed\n</a>\na 98 percent CBD drug for the boy and others like him.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteve DeAngelo, a pioneering pot entrepreneur.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\n‘Bubba D’ plants in the Clones &amp; Seeds section of Harborside, one of the first dispensary to laboratory test cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nPerhaps the most critical turning point for CBD came in August 2013, when a CNN special hosted by Dr. Sanjay Gupta profiled a 6-year-old girl in Colorado, Charlotte Figi, who used CBD to treat her epilepsy, as well as the brawny brothers who grew her CBD, the Stanleys. Hundreds of families — witnessing the power of CBD enhanced by cable news production values — moved to Colorado to gain access to the Stanleys’ CBD oil, called Charlotte’s Web. The Stanleys told me their wait-list peaked at 15,000 names. And because of public demand, the F.D.A. fast-tracked clinical trials of GW Pharmaceuticals’ 98 percent CBD drug, Epidiolex.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly, everyone wanted CBD, even though no one quite understood it. In the confusion, there was money to be made. Mere weeks after the CNN documentary aired, the spike in CBD interest prompted the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n<a title href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2013/finra-warns-investors-marijuana-stock-scams">\nto issue an investor alert\n</a>\non marijuana stock scams: As the F.D.A. would\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/warning-letters-and-test-results-cannabidiol-related-products">\nlater show\n</a>\n, many online CBD products contained little or no CBD whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIn 2020, CBD is available three ways:\n</strong>\nover the counter; at state-licensed marijuana dispensaries; or if you have certain forms of epilepsy, from GW Pharmaceuticals. Most Americans encounter CBD in the first and most unreliable way — at, say, a bodega in Brooklyn or a health food store in Indiana. A consultant hired to do an investigation by a corporate chain recently told me that the percentage of over-the-counter CBD products that contained the amount on the label was “in the single digits.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs if CBD’s back story couldn’t get any weirder, the path to this glut of phony CBD was paved by, of all people, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnrelated to the brouhaha on the West Coast, tobacco farmers in Kentucky were seeking a new cash crop. In 2011, James Comer won the race for Kentucky state agriculture commissioner by promising to legalize industrial hemp.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That raised a lot of eyebrows, including in McConnell’s office,” Eric Steenstra, a hemp lobbyist, told me. “They saw the winds were shifting.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlong with Representative Jared Polis, now the governor of Colorado, Mr. McConnell included a hemp pilot program in the 2014 farm bill — for “research.” In the legislation, hemp was defined as cannabis containing\n<a title href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/">\nless than 0.3 percent THC\n</a>\n— an arbitrary threshold, not a scientific distinction: Nothing in the Farm Bill, in case law, or in the Controlled Substances Act seemed to say anything about CBD. So entrepreneurs interpreted this research-oriented pilot program as the de facto legalization of cannabidiol.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration disagreed, but couldn’t stop the tidal wave of CBD production. In 2018,\n<a title href="https://www.kyagr.com/marketing/hemp-overview.html">\nover 60 percent\n</a>\nof the hemp crop in Kentucky was grown for CBD. Then, long after the country was already flooded with CBD products both dubious and legitimate, Mr. McConnell inserted language into the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly making hemp\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process">\nfederally legal\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany of the Californians who plotted at Ms. Miller’s house in 2011 have watched in frustration as the CBD industry flourished, divorced from THC, and fake CBD misled consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn his deathbed in 2014, Mr. Ringo insisted to friends and family that the Stanleys used his seeds to develop their famous strain Charlotte’s Web. Joel Stanley told me the genetics for Charlotte’s Web were a “cross of wild hemp with an industry genetic.” Critics of the Stanley brothers in the cannabis industry have grown annoyed by their prominence and push for patents. Their company has been valued at over half a billion dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller, who still runs a cannabis testing lab, told me that in the years since the 2011 summit, she has become disillusioned as people she’d thought had earnest intentions in spreading CBD turned out to just want to get rich. Mr. Gardner feels the same way.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteep Hill provides cannabis testing services to cultivators, processors, dispensaries, collectives and authorized medical cannabis patients.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nThere has been a slight uptick in clinical research around the compound’s relation to anxiety, schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. In September, the National Institutes of Health\n<a title href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-investigate-minor-cannabinoids-terpenes-potential-pain-relieving-properties">\napproved\n</a>\n$3 million in small grants for studies of cannabidiol and other non-THC cannabis compounds. Nevertheless, the government-enabled ham-handed rush to profiteering has seriously, and unduly, undermined CBD’s medical reputation.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven Dr. Turner, Mr. Reagan’s drug czar, said there is far more evidence for the benefits of Sativex, the half-CBD, half-THC drug, than for unregulated CBD online.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There haven’t been enough clinical trials and there never will be,” said Mr. Clarke, the cannabis seed collector. “There’s no vested financial interest in anyone doing it.” Big Pharma is most invested in medications that they can control, that they alone can patent.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill, some of the states with legal cannabis have implemented robust testing standards, and bona fide CBD can be found at many marijuana dispensaries, both on its own and in a variety of ratios with THC. Ms. Miller’s lab, and other responsible actors, are supposed to ensure products that hit legal pot shop shelves contain exactly what they claim to contain. But without stringent federal oversight, few in the CBD business will voluntarily opt-in to tests of their product labeling’s accuracy.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen I asked Dr. Russo, who oversaw much of GW Pharmaceuticals’ research, how he feels about it all, he sighed. “You do something, and other people run with it, and it turns into something else that you don’t recognize,” he said. “I’m always concerned, but what I like to dwell upon is: What is the real potential here?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Chicago Lewis (\n<a title href="https://twitter.com/msamandalewis">\n@msamandalewis\n</a>\n) is an investigative reporter, focusing on drug policy.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners.

If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people.

We believe that it is critical to move quickly and define such a standard, thereby freeing up researchers to innovate and diversify at the level of higher level algorithms and graph analytics applications. This effort was inspired by the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) of dense Linear Algebra, and hence our working name for this standard is “the GraphBLAS”.\n</p>\n<p>\nA key insight behind this work is that when a graph is represented by a sparse incidence or adjacency matrix, sparse matrix-vector multiplication is a step of breadth first search. By generalizing the pair of scalar operations involved in the linear algebra computations to define a semiring, we can extend the range of these primitives to support a wide range of parallel graph algorithms.\n</p>\n<h1>\n<span>\nMore information\n</span>\n</h1>\n<p>\nA C reference implementation, SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS, can be downloaded from\n<a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur 2013 manifesto for this project can be found\n<a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/PAPERS/GraphPrimitives-HPEC.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe mathematical definition of the GraphBLAS can be found\n<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kepner/GraphBLAS/GraphBLAS-Math-release.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBackground information about graphs in the language of linear algebra can be found in the book:\n<a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/se22/">\nGraph Algorithms in the Language of Linear Algebra\n</a>\n, edited by J.

Poor parts of the Midlands and north of England would get lots of infrastructure investment, helping them to close the productivity gap with London. The country would be “levelled up”.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe idea always seemed a little far-fetched. British governments have been trying to boost productivity outside London for decades, with not much success. And it seems less and less likely that the government will be able to focus on grand new designs as opposed to hasty repair jobs. But something else might happen, to spare Mr Johnson’s blushes. Rather than levelling up, Britain could be about to level down, as London sags.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon was not always the great success it is now. After the second world war the government, which had already pinched the capital with a thick Green Belt, deliberately pushed businesses and citizens out to “new towns” in the Home Counties. Manufacturing declined, as did the docks that had once provided jobs and prosperity. By the 1980s the city’s population had fallen by a quarter from the 8.6m it had hit in 1939. London’s schools and services were famously awful.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the Big Bang deregulated financial services in 1986, the logic of agglomeration reasserted itself and London took off. The creative industries and, in recent years, a thriving tech centre have joined the staples of banking, asset management and business services. Schools, policing and transport have all been transformed. People have flooded in from all continents, making London the world’s most global city.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet some warning signs have been visible for a while. Although London’s population has continued to grow, over the last decade that has been driven by international migration and the birth rate. Between 2008 and 2018, 550,000 more Britons left London than moved to it. People complain of high costs and anxiety. One league table in which London scores poorly is the Office for National Statistics’ rankings of well-being and life satisfaction. Since 2015 migration from the capital has helped reduce the differential between London’s house prices and those in the rest of the country (see chart).\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img src="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200523_BRC642.png">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBut London’s house prices remain double those elsewhere. After housing costs are accounted for Londoners are, on average, worse off than residents of the rest of southern England or Scotland. The chairman of\n<small>\nPWC\n</small>\n, a professional-services firm, has argued that graduates are turning their backs on London. Whereas 60% of graduates working for the big four accounting firms used to be based in the capital, in 2018 60% of new starters were outside.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe London office-cost premium is even higher than the housing-cost one. Prime square footage in the capital costs three times as much as space in other southern cities and seven to nine times as much as elsewhere in Britain. According to a legal recruitment firm, a company can save about £20,000 ($24,500) a year by moving a lawyer out of central London, after office costs and salary are taken into account. “Northshoring”—usually referring, confusingly, to places such as Birmingham that are far from northerly—has become something of a buzzword in the industry.\n<small>\nHSBC\n</small>\nchose to move its British retail banking headquarters to Birmingham in 2017. Amazon, an internet retailer, picked Manchester for its major British corporate site in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the coronavirus crushes property values and office rents, London might become a little less offputting. Perhaps some graduates will be tempted back from Leeds or Manchester. But covid-19 and the extreme social-distancing measures used to combat it pose a new and more profound danger to the capital, for they threaten two factors that have been central to its success: fun and foreigners.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon’s triumph is at least partially based on it being a fun place to live. “People come here not only because you can get paid well but because you can have a good time,” says Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy. The bars and cafes of the East End have been an important driver of what Mr McWillams once dubbed the “flat white economy”, where people with interesting hair bounce ideas off each other while drinking trendy beverages.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt is hard to have a flat white economy when you have to maintain two-metre distancing while queuing for your caffeine. Restaurateurs fear that being forced to operate at a lower capacity will drive many of them out of business. Theatres are facing disaster. As a hedge-fund manager puts it, “London without the culture and the restaurants is just a more expensive Frankfurt with more congestion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCovid-19 might combine with Brexit to cut international migration. Although foreign candidates for London jobs will score better on Britain’s new points-based immigration system than those for jobs elsewhere in the country, because the jobs are better paid, the signal has been sent: Britain is not keen on mass immigration. Universities fear that foreign student numbers could fall by 20-50% in the year ahead. For London, with its more than 100,000 foreign students, that is a problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike all great cities, London could also suffer from changing assumptions about work. Many firms now expect that some people will keep working from home even after the danger of coronavirus has receded—if not every day then several days a week. As firms learn to make do with smaller offices, workers might prize bigger homes outside London where they can have an office. The trade-off between space and commuting time looks different if you only have to go in two or three times a week. But if this happens, it will probably benefit commuter towns in the south-east rather than the northern and Midlands towns that Mr Johnson wanted to help.\n</p>\n<p>\nLisa Taylor of Coherent Cities, a consultancy, remains optimistic. “The next two years are going to be very tough,” she argues.“But a different city could emerge on the other side. One where land use has changed, where we have more co-working and co-living spaces.” She reckons that a greener, less congested London could take its inspiration from cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But those are hardly world-beating metropolises.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon is unlikely to slip back into the dismal state it was in before the mid-1980s. It is likely to remain richer and more productive than the rest of Britain. It will remain Europe’s most powerful magnet for talented immigrants. Still, its pulling power is likely to wane. If that happens, Britain’s economy will probably suffer.

They sat in a circle at a house in the hills a few hours north of San Francisco — where wine country becomes weed country — to discuss the therapeutic potential of CBD, and how to get people to take it seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeveral studies in rodents and in cell cultures had\n<a title href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462008000300015&lng=en&tlng=en">\nsuggested\n</a>\nthat CBD, a nonintoxicating compound from the cannabis plant more formally known as cannabidiol, could protect the nervous system, modulate blood flow, slow the growth of cancer cells and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We were talking about, ‘What can we do with this?’ ” recalled Samantha Miller, who hosted the event at her split-level house, wedged between redwoods and a creek below. A headstrong biochemist, she had been growing marijuana since the age of 14 and had just quit a six-figure job to start her own cannabis testing lab\n<strong>\n.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSamantha Miller at her home in northern California.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA ragtag crew of activists, doctors, writers and marijuana farmers met to discuss the potential of CBD in 2011 at Samantha Miller’s home.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nAfter two years of tracking down high-CBD pot plants and building momentum, the group began to devise ways to persuade more farmers to grow strains with CBD — which had largely been bred out of American pot since it doesn’t get you high. In addition to convincing marijuana dispensaries to widely carry CBD, they wanted to educate the public about its promising benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the group of ten or so brainstormed, a balloon of vaporized pot was passed in one direction and a bong in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There was a strong sense that this was really going to be something, if when people use these strains they have any kind of experience like the mice did in the laboratories,” said Martin Lee, a writer who at the time had been finishing a book\n<a title href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Smoke_Signals.html?id=8XE-AAAAQBAJ">\nabout the social history of marijuana\n</a>\nfor Simon &amp; Schuster.\n</p>\n<p>\nNear him was Stacey Kerr, a physician with flowing silver hair who served as treasurer of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, as well as Wade Laughter, a soft-spoken man in glasses who had started cultivating pot for his glaucoma in the mid-90s. Mr. Laughter and Lawrence Ringo, an old-school hippie grower, were some of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC — the compound that does get you high. Both pledged to keep their strains available for other growers at cheap prices. (Mr. Ringo said he would sell his seeds for as little as $5.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, there was Fred Gardner, a writer who had recruited almost all of these people to the CBD cause. A Harvard-educated former antiwar activist, now 78, Mr. Gardner had been writing about CBD since the late 1990s for publications like Synapse,\n<a title href="https://synapse.library.ucsf.edu/?a=d&d=ucsf19990701-01.2.4&srpos=2&e=-------en--20--1--txt-fred+gardner+gw-----txIN--">\nthe U.C. San Francisco weekly\n</a>\n. For years, he’d been determined to connect the nascent CBD research he heard about at symposiums abroad with the medical marijuana movement in California. And with this group, finally, it seemed to be coming together.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller spent the months after this meeting leading hundreds of CBD seminars for farmers; Dr. Kerr began informal patient surveys to track how CBD made people feel; and as he finished his book, Mr. Lee often traveled around with Mr. Laughter and Mr. Ringo’s high-CBD plants and seeds, spreading the gospel at pot shops across the West.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was aware that this was a pretty special moment,” Dr. Kerr told me, talking about the night at Ms. Miller’s. “That it was the beginning of something big, and we were there to see it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAt the time of Samantha Miller’s summit in 2011\n</strong>\n, THC was the sole chemical “face” of the plant. Cannabis containing significant amounts of CBD was still rare. Police raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana businesses were still common. And because CBD doesn’t get you high, it was easy to miss; hardly anyone outside of pharmaceutical companies and academia had heard of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the nine years since that night in the woods, one of the group’s biggest goals has clearly been accomplished: People know about CBD.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/opinion/24lewis4/merlin_170651910_ce93e3a5-32dd-4c3c-8a14-3e9a5751f199-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nIt has been estimated that the U.S. CBD industry will be worth $16 billion by 2025.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nJennifer Aniston loves beauty products made with it.

And e-commerce sales of CBD\n<a title href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/cbd-e-commerce-sales-are-booming-with-the-world-battling-covid-19-2020-04-06-71975826?mod=mw_quote_news">\nhave grown\n</a>\nthis year amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the CBD landscape of 2020 looks nothing like what the activists and scientists intended. That’s because the federal government’s insistence that cannabis has no legitimate use as a medicine created two enormous problems: the proliferation of fake CBD products and the nonsensical separation of CBD from THC.\n</p>\n<p>\nClinical studies\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16209908">\nhave shown\n</a>\nthat CBD is most effective when paired with at least some THC, even if it is not enough to cause a high. However, the United States considers cannabis with THC to be a Schedule 1 drug — which puts it in the same category as heroin, indicating a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This makes further research very difficult to do, and causes sick people in many states to be treated as criminals.\n</p>\n<p>\nCannabis that is high in CBD but extremely low in THC was made legal at the end of 2018. But finding an easy, affordable test that is able to distinguish cannabis with THC from cannabis without THC has been prohibitively difficult\n<a title href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/02/21/hot-hemp-pits-states-against-feds">\nfor farmers\n</a>\nand\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/cbd-thc-cannabis-cannabidiol.html">\ncrime labs\n</a>\nalike. So federal agencies have been\n<a title href="https://hempindustrydaily.com/fda-cbd-regulation-delay-is-costing-profits-and-shelf-space/">\nslow to regulate\n</a>\nthe booming industry — leading to a deluge of tinctures, smoothies and lotions that trusted tests have shown contain no CBD at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the absence of oversight, the push to get more patients access to cannabis medicine — and bona fide CBD — has been co-opted by a push to make as much money as possible off the next big wellness fad. “At a certain point, it had a life of its own,” Ms. Miller told me.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, the CBD industry promises a miracle drug but is often selling a placebo: cannabidiol products with zero cannabidiol inside. As a result, the compound is often caricatured as snake oil, a scam, even as promising research into the full potential of CBD is starting to pick up.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe compound’s reputation is a microcosm of what it means to be in America right now: a thing that some of us consider a hoax and others praise as the solution to everything. But CBD’s rollicking journey from the international underground to cultural ubiquity proves that, as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAs marijuana use increased in the 1960s and ’70s\n</strong>\n, and the Nixon administration criminalized drugs to vilify what\n<a title href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">\none aide described\n</a>\nas “the antiwar left and black people,” the more science-minded side of the government began funding some basic cannabis research. A man named Carlton Turner helped establish the government’s Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi. After that, he became President Ronald Reagan’s drug czar, helping to\n<a title href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-10-26-8603200589-story.html">\nexpand the War on Drugs\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut all the while, Mr. Turner was in touch with a Brazilian scientist named Elisaldo Carlini who had done\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7028792">\nsmall-scale human studies\n</a>\nshowing CBD reduced seizures: “All the early work on CBD was Carlini in Brazil,” Mr. Turner told me this past summer. “We were in communication for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFor decades, Dr. Carlini’s research was not replicated, in part because so few people had access to the compound: Both the pot held at the nation’s sole government-sanctioned marijuana lab at the University of Mississippi and the illegal pot being smoked around the country had only trace CBD content. (Mr. Turner even tested several kinds of cannabis sent by a legendary pot grower, a writer for “High Times” named Mel Frank. To no avail: none of it contained much CBD.)\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nCarlton Turner helped establish the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nThe University of Mississippi\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nIn those years, emissaries of California’s counterculture were often traveling the world looking for unique strains of cannabis. The most influential of these collectors was a man named David Watson. In the early 70s, Mr. Watson sold his possessions and began hitchhiking from Morocco to India, befriending local pot growers along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Watson ultimately settled in Amsterdam to examine his thousands of kinds of cannabis at his own Dutch state-licensed company, HortaPharm BV. He brought in a friend, an American botanist named Robert Connell Clarke to help. When Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke heard about the CBD research Dr. Carlini had done in Brazil, the pair identified and then bred CBD varietals. This led to a discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It attenuates the high,” Mr. Clarke told me over breakfast in Los Angeles. “That came strictly from anecdotal stoner evidence.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA marijuana plant.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nRobert Connell Clarke was an influential collector of unique strains of cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, after multiple sclerosis patients in England became more vocal about how cannabis helped their symptoms, the country allowed a small pharmaceutical company led by a British physician named\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nDr. Geoffrey Guy\n</a>\nto develop plant-derived cannabis medicines; GW Pharmaceuticals\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nlicensed varietals\n</a>\nbred from Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke’s collection of cannabis and got to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Within a couple of years, they figured out a 1:1 combination of a high-THC chemovar and a high-CBD chemovar presented the greatest latitude of effects and prevention of side effects,” said Dr. Ethan Russo, who worked with GW Pharmaceuticals from 1998 to 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke had discovered, having CBD in the mix reduced THC’s more uncomfortable effects: sedation, inebriation, a faster heart rate. And though a few outliers responded well to CBD alone, GW’s data showed that for relieving pain and inflammation, helping with sleep and alleviating seizures and spasms, most patients got the most benefit from an equal mix of CBD and THC — a drug the company called\n<a title href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-feb-01-me-medpot1-story.html">\nSativex\n</a>\n. But the research wasn’t enough. Although the drug has been approved for use in around 30 countries, the F.D.A. has yet to approve Sativex in the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nMr. Gardner, the writer whose CBD advocacy\n</strong>\neventually inspired the 2011 summit\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA copy of O’Shaughnessy’s, the Journal of Cannabis in Clinical Practice, from 2011.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nFred Gardner in his home on March 2, 2020.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nEnter, three years later, one of Oakland’s pioneering pot entrepreneurs, a medical marijuana impresario with pigtail braids named Steve DeAngelo. Mr. DeAngelo, who had been in contact with Mr. Gardner about the urgent need to institute better testing, agreed to help fund a cannabis analysis lab, Steep Hill, which began its operations in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Gardner came by frequently, chatting and checking in to see if Steep Hill’s founders had discovered the elusive compound. And at last, in February 2009 a dual peak on a testing graph appeared, indicating the presence of CBD.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I remember the moment,” said David Lampach, one of the lab’s funders and co-founders. “Seeing the dual peak and realizing it was real, and running it like five times to make sure.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the summer of 2009, the lab had identified five strains with significant CBD and THC. Mr. Gardner was elated, and began referring to his efforts as “Project CBD” alongside other supporters, including Mr. Lee, the writer. “Right away the thought was: ‘What is the government going to say about this? How can they be against something that’s nonintoxicating?’ ” Mr. Lee said.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June of 2010, the host of the 2011 summit, the biochemist Ms. Miller, opened her own lab, Pure Analytics. A few months later, she called Mr. Ringo, the hippie grower, to let him know a pot sample he sent in was a strain with a lot of CBD — as much as 11 percent.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nContainers of a cannabis flower samples at the Steep Hill lab, which began operations in 2008.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA technician macerating cannabis flower samples at Pure Analytics.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n“He’s in the trim room on speaker, and this big whoop goes up,” she said, remembering his staff’s excitement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 2010, a\n<a title href="https://www.projectcbd.org/">\nProject CBD\n</a>\nwebsite was set up where anyone could look through studies organized by disease or condition. Mr. Lee took charge of running it and it began to attract an audience. A few months later, the network of early CBD advocates met up at Ms. Miller’s house in California to coordinate their evangelism. And by the middle of 2011, word of cannabidiol had permeated the population that would become its most potent promotional engine: the chronically ill, people with cancer, with ALS, with serious disorders that weren’t responding to prescription drugs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs stories about CBD’s power spread, demand increased and prices rose. Sick people often relied on the generosity of growers like Mr. Ringo, his son Dakota told me.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nLawrence Ringo in Blocksburg, Calif., about 2010. He was of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKathleen Hart\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n“I’d go up there and see people dying of cancer hanging out with him, and he’d be hooking them up with oil he made in his house,” the younger Mr. Ringo said. Mike Hyde, whose son was suffering from brain cancer, spent months driving around Colorado and the West Coast looking for CBD in late 2011, before connecting with Mr. Ringo at a restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d never met this guy before, and he brought us literally probably $30,000 worth of oil for this CBD that no one could even get,” Mr. Hyde explained. “For free.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCBD’s big launch into the mainstream came when the world saw evidence of what Dr. Carlini had discovered in Brazil, back in the 1970s: the compound’s ability to quell seizures. Unlike a reduction in pain, this was something any politician or camera crew could easily see. It wasn’t a stoner scam.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, in December 2011, an epileptic child used CBD on the Discovery Channel’s “Weed Wars,” a show featuring the co-founder of the Steep Hill lab, Mr. DeAngelo. The following year, the parents of an epileptic boy in San Francisco\n<a title href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/medical-marijuana-epilepsy/">\nbought\n</a>\nCBD from a pot shop. Then, looking for a better quality product, they contacted GW Pharmaceuticals — the British company that had licensed the cannabis collection of those globe-trotting 20th century cannabis collectors, Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke, and which conducted the research in the ’90s that spurred Mr. Gardner’s CBD advocacy. The\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\ncompany developed\n</a>\na 98 percent CBD drug for the boy and others like him.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteve DeAngelo, a pioneering pot entrepreneur.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\n‘Bubba D’ plants in the Clones &amp; Seeds section of Harborside, one of the first dispensary to laboratory test cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nPerhaps the most critical turning point for CBD came in August 2013, when a CNN special hosted by Dr. Sanjay Gupta profiled a 6-year-old girl in Colorado, Charlotte Figi, who used CBD to treat her epilepsy, as well as the brawny brothers who grew her CBD, the Stanleys. Hundreds of families — witnessing the power of CBD enhanced by cable news production values — moved to Colorado to gain access to the Stanleys’ CBD oil, called Charlotte’s Web. The Stanleys told me their wait-list peaked at 15,000 names. And because of public demand, the F.D.A. fast-tracked clinical trials of GW Pharmaceuticals’ 98 percent CBD drug, Epidiolex.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly, everyone wanted CBD, even though no one quite understood it. In the confusion, there was money to be made. Mere weeks after the CNN documentary aired, the spike in CBD interest prompted the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n<a title href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2013/finra-warns-investors-marijuana-stock-scams">\nto issue an investor alert\n</a>\non marijuana stock scams: As the F.D.A. would\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/warning-letters-and-test-results-cannabidiol-related-products">\nlater show\n</a>\n, many online CBD products contained little or no CBD whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIn 2020, CBD is available three ways:\n</strong>\nover the counter; at state-licensed marijuana dispensaries; or if you have certain forms of epilepsy, from GW Pharmaceuticals. Most Americans encounter CBD in the first and most unreliable way — at, say, a bodega in Brooklyn or a health food store in Indiana. A consultant hired to do an investigation by a corporate chain recently told me that the percentage of over-the-counter CBD products that contained the amount on the label was “in the single digits.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs if CBD’s back story couldn’t get any weirder, the path to this glut of phony CBD was paved by, of all people, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnrelated to the brouhaha on the West Coast, tobacco farmers in Kentucky were seeking a new cash crop. In 2011, James Comer won the race for Kentucky state agriculture commissioner by promising to legalize industrial hemp.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That raised a lot of eyebrows, including in McConnell’s office,” Eric Steenstra, a hemp lobbyist, told me. “They saw the winds were shifting.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlong with Representative Jared Polis, now the governor of Colorado, Mr. McConnell included a hemp pilot program in the 2014 farm bill — for “research.” In the legislation, hemp was defined as cannabis containing\n<a title href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/">\nless than 0.3 percent THC\n</a>\n— an arbitrary threshold, not a scientific distinction: Nothing in the Farm Bill, in case law, or in the Controlled Substances Act seemed to say anything about CBD. So entrepreneurs interpreted this research-oriented pilot program as the de facto legalization of cannabidiol.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration disagreed, but couldn’t stop the tidal wave of CBD production. In 2018,\n<a title href="https://www.kyagr.com/marketing/hemp-overview.html">\nover 60 percent\n</a>\nof the hemp crop in Kentucky was grown for CBD. Then, long after the country was already flooded with CBD products both dubious and legitimate, Mr. McConnell inserted language into the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly making hemp\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process">\nfederally legal\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany of the Californians who plotted at Ms. Miller’s house in 2011 have watched in frustration as the CBD industry flourished, divorced from THC, and fake CBD misled consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn his deathbed in 2014, Mr. Ringo insisted to friends and family that the Stanleys used his seeds to develop their famous strain Charlotte’s Web. Joel Stanley told me the genetics for Charlotte’s Web were a “cross of wild hemp with an industry genetic.” Critics of the Stanley brothers in the cannabis industry have grown annoyed by their prominence and push for patents. Their company has been valued at over half a billion dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller, who still runs a cannabis testing lab, told me that in the years since the 2011 summit, she has become disillusioned as people she’d thought had earnest intentions in spreading CBD turned out to just want to get rich. Mr. Gardner feels the same way.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteep Hill provides cannabis testing services to cultivators, processors, dispensaries, collectives and authorized medical cannabis patients.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nThere has been a slight uptick in clinical research around the compound’s relation to anxiety, schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. In September, the National Institutes of Health\n<a title href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-investigate-minor-cannabinoids-terpenes-potential-pain-relieving-properties">\napproved\n</a>\n$3 million in small grants for studies of cannabidiol and other non-THC cannabis compounds. Nevertheless, the government-enabled ham-handed rush to profiteering has seriously, and unduly, undermined CBD’s medical reputation.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven Dr. Turner, Mr. Reagan’s drug czar, said there is far more evidence for the benefits of Sativex, the half-CBD, half-THC drug, than for unregulated CBD online.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There haven’t been enough clinical trials and there never will be,” said Mr. Clarke, the cannabis seed collector. “There’s no vested financial interest in anyone doing it.” Big Pharma is most invested in medications that they can control, that they alone can patent.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill, some of the states with legal cannabis have implemented robust testing standards, and bona fide CBD can be found at many marijuana dispensaries, both on its own and in a variety of ratios with THC. Ms. Miller’s lab, and other responsible actors, are supposed to ensure products that hit legal pot shop shelves contain exactly what they claim to contain. But without stringent federal oversight, few in the CBD business will voluntarily opt-in to tests of their product labeling’s accuracy.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen I asked Dr. Russo, who oversaw much of GW Pharmaceuticals’ research, how he feels about it all, he sighed. “You do something, and other people run with it, and it turns into something else that you don’t recognize,” he said. “I’m always concerned, but what I like to dwell upon is: What is the real potential here?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Chicago Lewis (\n<a title href="https://twitter.com/msamandalewis">\n@msamandalewis\n</a>\n) is an investigative reporter, focusing on drug policy.

If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes.

We believe that it is critical to move quickly and define such a standard, thereby freeing up researchers to innovate and diversify at the level of higher level algorithms and graph analytics applications. This effort was inspired by the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) of dense Linear Algebra, and hence our working name for this standard is “the GraphBLAS”.\n</p>\n<p>\nA key insight behind this work is that when a graph is represented by a sparse incidence or adjacency matrix, sparse matrix-vector multiplication is a step of breadth first search. By generalizing the pair of scalar operations involved in the linear algebra computations to define a semiring, we can extend the range of these primitives to support a wide range of parallel graph algorithms.\n</p>\n<h1>\n<span>\nMore information\n</span>\n</h1>\n<p>\nA C reference implementation, SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS, can be downloaded from\n<a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur 2013 manifesto for this project can be found\n<a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/PAPERS/GraphPrimitives-HPEC.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe mathematical definition of the GraphBLAS can be found\n<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kepner/GraphBLAS/GraphBLAS-Math-release.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBackground information about graphs in the language of linear algebra can be found in the book:\n<a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/se22/">\nGraph Algorithms in the Language of Linear Algebra\n</a>\n, edited by J.

Poor parts of the Midlands and north of England would get lots of infrastructure investment, helping them to close the productivity gap with London. The country would be “levelled up”.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe idea always seemed a little far-fetched. British governments have been trying to boost productivity outside London for decades, with not much success. And it seems less and less likely that the government will be able to focus on grand new designs as opposed to hasty repair jobs. But something else might happen, to spare Mr Johnson’s blushes. Rather than levelling up, Britain could be about to level down, as London sags.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon was not always the great success it is now. After the second world war the government, which had already pinched the capital with a thick Green Belt, deliberately pushed businesses and citizens out to “new towns” in the Home Counties. Manufacturing declined, as did the docks that had once provided jobs and prosperity. By the 1980s the city’s population had fallen by a quarter from the 8.6m it had hit in 1939. London’s schools and services were famously awful.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the Big Bang deregulated financial services in 1986, the logic of agglomeration reasserted itself and London took off. The creative industries and, in recent years, a thriving tech centre have joined the staples of banking, asset management and business services. Schools, policing and transport have all been transformed. People have flooded in from all continents, making London the world’s most global city.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet some warning signs have been visible for a while. Although London’s population has continued to grow, over the last decade that has been driven by international migration and the birth rate. Between 2008 and 2018, 550,000 more Britons left London than moved to it. People complain of high costs and anxiety. One league table in which London scores poorly is the Office for National Statistics’ rankings of well-being and life satisfaction. Since 2015 migration from the capital has helped reduce the differential between London’s house prices and those in the rest of the country (see chart).\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img src="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200523_BRC642.png">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBut London’s house prices remain double those elsewhere. After housing costs are accounted for Londoners are, on average, worse off than residents of the rest of southern England or Scotland. The chairman of\n<small>\nPWC\n</small>\n, a professional-services firm, has argued that graduates are turning their backs on London. Whereas 60% of graduates working for the big four accounting firms used to be based in the capital, in 2018 60% of new starters were outside.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe London office-cost premium is even higher than the housing-cost one. Prime square footage in the capital costs three times as much as space in other southern cities and seven to nine times as much as elsewhere in Britain. According to a legal recruitment firm, a company can save about £20,000 ($24,500) a year by moving a lawyer out of central London, after office costs and salary are taken into account. “Northshoring”—usually referring, confusingly, to places such as Birmingham that are far from northerly—has become something of a buzzword in the industry.\n<small>\nHSBC\n</small>\nchose to move its British retail banking headquarters to Birmingham in 2017. Amazon, an internet retailer, picked Manchester for its major British corporate site in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the coronavirus crushes property values and office rents, London might become a little less offputting. Perhaps some graduates will be tempted back from Leeds or Manchester. But covid-19 and the extreme social-distancing measures used to combat it pose a new and more profound danger to the capital, for they threaten two factors that have been central to its success: fun and foreigners.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon’s triumph is at least partially based on it being a fun place to live. “People come here not only because you can get paid well but because you can have a good time,” says Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy. The bars and cafes of the East End have been an important driver of what Mr McWillams once dubbed the “flat white economy”, where people with interesting hair bounce ideas off each other while drinking trendy beverages.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt is hard to have a flat white economy when you have to maintain two-metre distancing while queuing for your caffeine. Restaurateurs fear that being forced to operate at a lower capacity will drive many of them out of business. Theatres are facing disaster. As a hedge-fund manager puts it, “London without the culture and the restaurants is just a more expensive Frankfurt with more congestion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCovid-19 might combine with Brexit to cut international migration. Although foreign candidates for London jobs will score better on Britain’s new points-based immigration system than those for jobs elsewhere in the country, because the jobs are better paid, the signal has been sent: Britain is not keen on mass immigration. Universities fear that foreign student numbers could fall by 20-50% in the year ahead. For London, with its more than 100,000 foreign students, that is a problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike all great cities, London could also suffer from changing assumptions about work. Many firms now expect that some people will keep working from home even after the danger of coronavirus has receded—if not every day then several days a week. As firms learn to make do with smaller offices, workers might prize bigger homes outside London where they can have an office. The trade-off between space and commuting time looks different if you only have to go in two or three times a week. But if this happens, it will probably benefit commuter towns in the south-east rather than the northern and Midlands towns that Mr Johnson wanted to help.\n</p>\n<p>\nLisa Taylor of Coherent Cities, a consultancy, remains optimistic. “The next two years are going to be very tough,” she argues.“But a different city could emerge on the other side. One where land use has changed, where we have more co-working and co-living spaces.” She reckons that a greener, less congested London could take its inspiration from cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But those are hardly world-beating metropolises.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon is unlikely to slip back into the dismal state it was in before the mid-1980s. It is likely to remain richer and more productive than the rest of Britain. It will remain Europe’s most powerful magnet for talented immigrants. Still, its pulling power is likely to wane. If that happens, Britain’s economy will probably suffer. But a less centralised country, in which opportunity was more evenly distributed, might be a better place in other ways.\n<span>\n■\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\nEditor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of\n</em>\nThe Economist Today\n<em>\n, our daily\n<a href="https://my.economist.com/user#newsletter">\nnewsletter\n</a>\n.

They sat in a circle at a house in the hills a few hours north of San Francisco — where wine country becomes weed country — to discuss the therapeutic potential of CBD, and how to get people to take it seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeveral studies in rodents and in cell cultures had\n<a title href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462008000300015&lng=en&tlng=en">\nsuggested\n</a>\nthat CBD, a nonintoxicating compound from the cannabis plant more formally known as cannabidiol, could protect the nervous system, modulate blood flow, slow the growth of cancer cells and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We were talking about, ‘What can we do with this?’ ” recalled Samantha Miller, who hosted the event at her split-level house, wedged between redwoods and a creek below. A headstrong biochemist, she had been growing marijuana since the age of 14 and had just quit a six-figure job to start her own cannabis testing lab\n<strong>\n.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSamantha Miller at her home in northern California.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA ragtag crew of activists, doctors, writers and marijuana farmers met to discuss the potential of CBD in 2011 at Samantha Miller’s home.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nAfter two years of tracking down high-CBD pot plants and building momentum, the group began to devise ways to persuade more farmers to grow strains with CBD — which had largely been bred out of American pot since it doesn’t get you high. In addition to convincing marijuana dispensaries to widely carry CBD, they wanted to educate the public about its promising benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the group of ten or so brainstormed, a balloon of vaporized pot was passed in one direction and a bong in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There was a strong sense that this was really going to be something, if when people use these strains they have any kind of experience like the mice did in the laboratories,” said Martin Lee, a writer who at the time had been finishing a book\n<a title href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Smoke_Signals.html?id=8XE-AAAAQBAJ">\nabout the social history of marijuana\n</a>\nfor Simon &amp; Schuster.\n</p>\n<p>\nNear him was Stacey Kerr, a physician with flowing silver hair who served as treasurer of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, as well as Wade Laughter, a soft-spoken man in glasses who had started cultivating pot for his glaucoma in the mid-90s. Mr. Laughter and Lawrence Ringo, an old-school hippie grower, were some of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC — the compound that does get you high. Both pledged to keep their strains available for other growers at cheap prices. (Mr. Ringo said he would sell his seeds for as little as $5.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, there was Fred Gardner, a writer who had recruited almost all of these people to the CBD cause. A Harvard-educated former antiwar activist, now 78, Mr. Gardner had been writing about CBD since the late 1990s for publications like Synapse,\n<a title href="https://synapse.library.ucsf.edu/?a=d&d=ucsf19990701-01.2.4&srpos=2&e=-------en--20--1--txt-fred+gardner+gw-----txIN--">\nthe U.C. San Francisco weekly\n</a>\n. For years, he’d been determined to connect the nascent CBD research he heard about at symposiums abroad with the medical marijuana movement in California. And with this group, finally, it seemed to be coming together.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller spent the months after this meeting leading hundreds of CBD seminars for farmers; Dr. Kerr began informal patient surveys to track how CBD made people feel; and as he finished his book, Mr. Lee often traveled around with Mr. Laughter and Mr. Ringo’s high-CBD plants and seeds, spreading the gospel at pot shops across the West.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was aware that this was a pretty special moment,” Dr. Kerr told me, talking about the night at Ms. Miller’s. “That it was the beginning of something big, and we were there to see it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAt the time of Samantha Miller’s summit in 2011\n</strong>\n, THC was the sole chemical “face” of the plant. Cannabis containing significant amounts of CBD was still rare. Police raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana businesses were still common. And because CBD doesn’t get you high, it was easy to miss; hardly anyone outside of pharmaceutical companies and academia had heard of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the nine years since that night in the woods, one of the group’s biggest goals has clearly been accomplished: People know about CBD.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/opinion/24lewis4/merlin_170651910_ce93e3a5-32dd-4c3c-8a14-3e9a5751f199-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nIt has been estimated that the U.S. CBD industry will be worth $16 billion by 2025.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nJennifer Aniston loves beauty products made with it.

That’s because the federal government’s insistence that cannabis has no legitimate use as a medicine created two enormous problems: the proliferation of fake CBD products and the nonsensical separation of CBD from THC.\n</p>\n<p>\nClinical studies\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16209908">\nhave shown\n</a>\nthat CBD is most effective when paired with at least some THC, even if it is not enough to cause a high. However, the United States considers cannabis with THC to be a Schedule 1 drug — which puts it in the same category as heroin, indicating a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This makes further research very difficult to do, and causes sick people in many states to be treated as criminals.\n</p>\n<p>\nCannabis that is high in CBD but extremely low in THC was made legal at the end of 2018. But finding an easy, affordable test that is able to distinguish cannabis with THC from cannabis without THC has been prohibitively difficult\n<a title href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/02/21/hot-hemp-pits-states-against-feds">\nfor farmers\n</a>\nand\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/cbd-thc-cannabis-cannabidiol.html">\ncrime labs\n</a>\nalike. So federal agencies have been\n<a title href="https://hempindustrydaily.com/fda-cbd-regulation-delay-is-costing-profits-and-shelf-space/">\nslow to regulate\n</a>\nthe booming industry — leading to a deluge of tinctures, smoothies and lotions that trusted tests have shown contain no CBD at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the absence of oversight, the push to get more patients access to cannabis medicine — and bona fide CBD — has been co-opted by a push to make as much money as possible off the next big wellness fad. “At a certain point, it had a life of its own,” Ms. Miller told me.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, the CBD industry promises a miracle drug but is often selling a placebo: cannabidiol products with zero cannabidiol inside. As a result, the compound is often caricatured as snake oil, a scam, even as promising research into the full potential of CBD is starting to pick up.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe compound’s reputation is a microcosm of what it means to be in America right now: a thing that some of us consider a hoax and others praise as the solution to everything. But CBD’s rollicking journey from the international underground to cultural ubiquity proves that, as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAs marijuana use increased in the 1960s and ’70s\n</strong>\n, and the Nixon administration criminalized drugs to vilify what\n<a title href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">\none aide described\n</a>\nas “the antiwar left and black people,” the more science-minded side of the government began funding some basic cannabis research. A man named Carlton Turner helped establish the government’s Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi. After that, he became President Ronald Reagan’s drug czar, helping to\n<a title href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-10-26-8603200589-story.html">\nexpand the War on Drugs\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut all the while, Mr. Turner was in touch with a Brazilian scientist named Elisaldo Carlini who had done\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7028792">\nsmall-scale human studies\n</a>\nshowing CBD reduced seizures: “All the early work on CBD was Carlini in Brazil,” Mr. Turner told me this past summer. “We were in communication for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFor decades, Dr. Carlini’s research was not replicated, in part because so few people had access to the compound: Both the pot held at the nation’s sole government-sanctioned marijuana lab at the University of Mississippi and the illegal pot being smoked around the country had only trace CBD content. (Mr. Turner even tested several kinds of cannabis sent by a legendary pot grower, a writer for “High Times” named Mel Frank. To no avail: none of it contained much CBD.)\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nCarlton Turner helped establish the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nThe University of Mississippi\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nIn those years, emissaries of California’s counterculture were often traveling the world looking for unique strains of cannabis. The most influential of these collectors was a man named David Watson. In the early 70s, Mr. Watson sold his possessions and began hitchhiking from Morocco to India, befriending local pot growers along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Watson ultimately settled in Amsterdam to examine his thousands of kinds of cannabis at his own Dutch state-licensed company, HortaPharm BV. He brought in a friend, an American botanist named Robert Connell Clarke to help. When Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke heard about the CBD research Dr. Carlini had done in Brazil, the pair identified and then bred CBD varietals. This led to a discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It attenuates the high,” Mr. Clarke told me over breakfast in Los Angeles. “That came strictly from anecdotal stoner evidence.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA marijuana plant.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nRobert Connell Clarke was an influential collector of unique strains of cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, after multiple sclerosis patients in England became more vocal about how cannabis helped their symptoms, the country allowed a small pharmaceutical company led by a British physician named\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nDr. Geoffrey Guy\n</a>\nto develop plant-derived cannabis medicines; GW Pharmaceuticals\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nlicensed varietals\n</a>\nbred from Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke’s collection of cannabis and got to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Within a couple of years, they figured out a 1:1 combination of a high-THC chemovar and a high-CBD chemovar presented the greatest latitude of effects and prevention of side effects,” said Dr. Ethan Russo, who worked with GW Pharmaceuticals from 1998 to 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke had discovered, having CBD in the mix reduced THC’s more uncomfortable effects: sedation, inebriation, a faster heart rate. And though a few outliers responded well to CBD alone, GW’s data showed that for relieving pain and inflammation, helping with sleep and alleviating seizures and spasms, most patients got the most benefit from an equal mix of CBD and THC — a drug the company called\n<a title href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-feb-01-me-medpot1-story.html">\nSativex\n</a>\n. But the research wasn’t enough. Although the drug has been approved for use in around 30 countries, the F.D.A. has yet to approve Sativex in the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nMr. Gardner, the writer whose CBD advocacy\n</strong>\neventually inspired the 2011 summit\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA copy of O’Shaughnessy’s, the Journal of Cannabis in Clinical Practice, from 2011.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nFred Gardner in his home on March 2, 2020.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nEnter, three years later, one of Oakland’s pioneering pot entrepreneurs, a medical marijuana impresario with pigtail braids named Steve DeAngelo. Mr. DeAngelo, who had been in contact with Mr. Gardner about the urgent need to institute better testing, agreed to help fund a cannabis analysis lab, Steep Hill, which began its operations in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Gardner came by frequently, chatting and checking in to see if Steep Hill’s founders had discovered the elusive compound. And at last, in February 2009 a dual peak on a testing graph appeared, indicating the presence of CBD.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I remember the moment,” said David Lampach, one of the lab’s funders and co-founders. “Seeing the dual peak and realizing it was real, and running it like five times to make sure.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the summer of 2009, the lab had identified five strains with significant CBD and THC. Mr. Gardner was elated, and began referring to his efforts as “Project CBD” alongside other supporters, including Mr. Lee, the writer. “Right away the thought was: ‘What is the government going to say about this? How can they be against something that’s nonintoxicating?’ ” Mr. Lee said.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June of 2010, the host of the 2011 summit, the biochemist Ms. Miller, opened her own lab, Pure Analytics. A few months later, she called Mr. Ringo, the hippie grower, to let him know a pot sample he sent in was a strain with a lot of CBD — as much as 11 percent.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nContainers of a cannabis flower samples at the Steep Hill lab, which began operations in 2008.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA technician macerating cannabis flower samples at Pure Analytics.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n“He’s in the trim room on speaker, and this big whoop goes up,” she said, remembering his staff’s excitement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 2010, a\n<a title href="https://www.projectcbd.org/">\nProject CBD\n</a>\nwebsite was set up where anyone could look through studies organized by disease or condition. Mr. Lee took charge of running it and it began to attract an audience. A few months later, the network of early CBD advocates met up at Ms. Miller’s house in California to coordinate their evangelism. And by the middle of 2011, word of cannabidiol had permeated the population that would become its most potent promotional engine: the chronically ill, people with cancer, with ALS, with serious disorders that weren’t responding to prescription drugs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs stories about CBD’s power spread, demand increased and prices rose. Sick people often relied on the generosity of growers like Mr. Ringo, his son Dakota told me.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nLawrence Ringo in Blocksburg, Calif., about 2010. He was of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKathleen Hart\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n“I’d go up there and see people dying of cancer hanging out with him, and he’d be hooking them up with oil he made in his house,” the younger Mr. Ringo said. Mike Hyde, whose son was suffering from brain cancer, spent months driving around Colorado and the West Coast looking for CBD in late 2011, before connecting with Mr. Ringo at a restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d never met this guy before, and he brought us literally probably $30,000 worth of oil for this CBD that no one could even get,” Mr. Hyde explained. “For free.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCBD’s big launch into the mainstream came when the world saw evidence of what Dr. Carlini had discovered in Brazil, back in the 1970s: the compound’s ability to quell seizures. Unlike a reduction in pain, this was something any politician or camera crew could easily see. It wasn’t a stoner scam.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, in December 2011, an epileptic child used CBD on the Discovery Channel’s “Weed Wars,” a show featuring the co-founder of the Steep Hill lab, Mr. DeAngelo. The following year, the parents of an epileptic boy in San Francisco\n<a title href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/medical-marijuana-epilepsy/">\nbought\n</a>\nCBD from a pot shop. Then, looking for a better quality product, they contacted GW Pharmaceuticals — the British company that had licensed the cannabis collection of those globe-trotting 20th century cannabis collectors, Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke, and which conducted the research in the ’90s that spurred Mr. Gardner’s CBD advocacy. The\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\ncompany developed\n</a>\na 98 percent CBD drug for the boy and others like him.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteve DeAngelo, a pioneering pot entrepreneur.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\n‘Bubba D’ plants in the Clones &amp; Seeds section of Harborside, one of the first dispensary to laboratory test cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nPerhaps the most critical turning point for CBD came in August 2013, when a CNN special hosted by Dr. Sanjay Gupta profiled a 6-year-old girl in Colorado, Charlotte Figi, who used CBD to treat her epilepsy, as well as the brawny brothers who grew her CBD, the Stanleys. Hundreds of families — witnessing the power of CBD enhanced by cable news production values — moved to Colorado to gain access to the Stanleys’ CBD oil, called Charlotte’s Web. The Stanleys told me their wait-list peaked at 15,000 names. And because of public demand, the F.D.A. fast-tracked clinical trials of GW Pharmaceuticals’ 98 percent CBD drug, Epidiolex.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly, everyone wanted CBD, even though no one quite understood it. In the confusion, there was money to be made. Mere weeks after the CNN documentary aired, the spike in CBD interest prompted the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n<a title href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2013/finra-warns-investors-marijuana-stock-scams">\nto issue an investor alert\n</a>\non marijuana stock scams: As the F.D.A. would\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/warning-letters-and-test-results-cannabidiol-related-products">\nlater show\n</a>\n, many online CBD products contained little or no CBD whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIn 2020, CBD is available three ways:\n</strong>\nover the counter; at state-licensed marijuana dispensaries; or if you have certain forms of epilepsy, from GW Pharmaceuticals. Most Americans encounter CBD in the first and most unreliable way — at, say, a bodega in Brooklyn or a health food store in Indiana. A consultant hired to do an investigation by a corporate chain recently told me that the percentage of over-the-counter CBD products that contained the amount on the label was “in the single digits.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs if CBD’s back story couldn’t get any weirder, the path to this glut of phony CBD was paved by, of all people, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnrelated to the brouhaha on the West Coast, tobacco farmers in Kentucky were seeking a new cash crop. In 2011, James Comer won the race for Kentucky state agriculture commissioner by promising to legalize industrial hemp.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That raised a lot of eyebrows, including in McConnell’s office,” Eric Steenstra, a hemp lobbyist, told me. “They saw the winds were shifting.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlong with Representative Jared Polis, now the governor of Colorado, Mr. McConnell included a hemp pilot program in the 2014 farm bill — for “research.” In the legislation, hemp was defined as cannabis containing\n<a title href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/">\nless than 0.3 percent THC\n</a>\n— an arbitrary threshold, not a scientific distinction: Nothing in the Farm Bill, in case law, or in the Controlled Substances Act seemed to say anything about CBD. So entrepreneurs interpreted this research-oriented pilot program as the de facto legalization of cannabidiol.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration disagreed, but couldn’t stop the tidal wave of CBD production. In 2018,\n<a title href="https://www.kyagr.com/marketing/hemp-overview.html">\nover 60 percent\n</a>\nof the hemp crop in Kentucky was grown for CBD. Then, long after the country was already flooded with CBD products both dubious and legitimate, Mr. McConnell inserted language into the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly making hemp\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process">\nfederally legal\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany of the Californians who plotted at Ms. Miller’s house in 2011 have watched in frustration as the CBD industry flourished, divorced from THC, and fake CBD misled consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn his deathbed in 2014, Mr. Ringo insisted to friends and family that the Stanleys used his seeds to develop their famous strain Charlotte’s Web. Joel Stanley told me the genetics for Charlotte’s Web were a “cross of wild hemp with an industry genetic.” Critics of the Stanley brothers in the cannabis industry have grown annoyed by their prominence and push for patents. Their company has been valued at over half a billion dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller, who still runs a cannabis testing lab, told me that in the years since the 2011 summit, she has become disillusioned as people she’d thought had earnest intentions in spreading CBD turned out to just want to get rich. Mr. Gardner feels the same way.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteep Hill provides cannabis testing services to cultivators, processors, dispensaries, collectives and authorized medical cannabis patients.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nThere has been a slight uptick in clinical research around the compound’s relation to anxiety, schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. In September, the National Institutes of Health\n<a title href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-investigate-minor-cannabinoids-terpenes-potential-pain-relieving-properties">\napproved\n</a>\n$3 million in small grants for studies of cannabidiol and other non-THC cannabis compounds. Nevertheless, the government-enabled ham-handed rush to profiteering has seriously, and unduly, undermined CBD’s medical reputation.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven Dr. Turner, Mr. Reagan’s drug czar, said there is far more evidence for the benefits of Sativex, the half-CBD, half-THC drug, than for unregulated CBD online.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There haven’t been enough clinical trials and there never will be,” said Mr. Clarke, the cannabis seed collector. “There’s no vested financial interest in anyone doing it.” Big Pharma is most invested in medications that they can control, that they alone can patent.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill, some of the states with legal cannabis have implemented robust testing standards, and bona fide CBD can be found at many marijuana dispensaries, both on its own and in a variety of ratios with THC. Ms. Miller’s lab, and other responsible actors, are supposed to ensure products that hit legal pot shop shelves contain exactly what they claim to contain. But without stringent federal oversight, few in the CBD business will voluntarily opt-in to tests of their product labeling’s accuracy.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen I asked Dr. Russo, who oversaw much of GW Pharmaceuticals’ research, how he feels about it all, he sighed. “You do something, and other people run with it, and it turns into something else that you don’t recognize,” he said. “I’m always concerned, but what I like to dwell upon is: What is the real potential here?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Chicago Lewis (\n<a title href="https://twitter.com/msamandalewis">\n@msamandalewis\n</a>\n) is an investigative reporter, focusing on drug policy.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I protect myself while flying?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf air travel is unavoidable,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html">\nthere are some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n</a>\nMost important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public.

Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor.

A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public.

Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor.

We believe that it is critical to move quickly and define such a standard, thereby freeing up researchers to innovate and diversify at the level of higher level algorithms and graph analytics applications. This effort was inspired by the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) of dense Linear Algebra, and hence our working name for this standard is “the GraphBLAS”.\n</p>\n<p>\nA key insight behind this work is that when a graph is represented by a sparse incidence or adjacency matrix, sparse matrix-vector multiplication is a step of breadth first search. By generalizing the pair of scalar operations involved in the linear algebra computations to define a semiring, we can extend the range of these primitives to support a wide range of parallel graph algorithms.\n</p>\n<h1>\n<span>\nMore information\n</span>\n</h1>\n<p>\nA C reference implementation, SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS, can be downloaded from\n<a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur 2013 manifesto for this project can be found\n<a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/PAPERS/GraphPrimitives-HPEC.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe mathematical definition of the GraphBLAS can be found\n<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kepner/GraphBLAS/GraphBLAS-Math-release.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBackground information about graphs in the language of linear algebra can be found in the book:\n<a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/se22/">\nGraph Algorithms in the Language of Linear Algebra\n</a>\n, edited by J.

And it seems less and less likely that the government will be able to focus on grand new designs as opposed to hasty repair jobs. But something else might happen, to spare Mr Johnson’s blushes. Rather than levelling up, Britain could be about to level down, as London sags.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon was not always the great success it is now. After the second world war the government, which had already pinched the capital with a thick Green Belt, deliberately pushed businesses and citizens out to “new towns” in the Home Counties. Manufacturing declined, as did the docks that had once provided jobs and prosperity. By the 1980s the city’s population had fallen by a quarter from the 8.6m it had hit in 1939. London’s schools and services were famously awful.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the Big Bang deregulated financial services in 1986, the logic of agglomeration reasserted itself and London took off. The creative industries and, in recent years, a thriving tech centre have joined the staples of banking, asset management and business services. Schools, policing and transport have all been transformed. People have flooded in from all continents, making London the world’s most global city.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet some warning signs have been visible for a while. Although London’s population has continued to grow, over the last decade that has been driven by international migration and the birth rate. Between 2008 and 2018, 550,000 more Britons left London than moved to it. People complain of high costs and anxiety. One league table in which London scores poorly is the Office for National Statistics’ rankings of well-being and life satisfaction. Since 2015 migration from the capital has helped reduce the differential between London’s house prices and those in the rest of the country (see chart).\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img src="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200523_BRC642.png">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBut London’s house prices remain double those elsewhere. After housing costs are accounted for Londoners are, on average, worse off than residents of the rest of southern England or Scotland. The chairman of\n<small>\nPWC\n</small>\n, a professional-services firm, has argued that graduates are turning their backs on London. Whereas 60% of graduates working for the big four accounting firms used to be based in the capital, in 2018 60% of new starters were outside.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe London office-cost premium is even higher than the housing-cost one. Prime square footage in the capital costs three times as much as space in other southern cities and seven to nine times as much as elsewhere in Britain. According to a legal recruitment firm, a company can save about £20,000 ($24,500) a year by moving a lawyer out of central London, after office costs and salary are taken into account. “Northshoring”—usually referring, confusingly, to places such as Birmingham that are far from northerly—has become something of a buzzword in the industry.\n<small>\nHSBC\n</small>\nchose to move its British retail banking headquarters to Birmingham in 2017. Amazon, an internet retailer, picked Manchester for its major British corporate site in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the coronavirus crushes property values and office rents, London might become a little less offputting. Perhaps some graduates will be tempted back from Leeds or Manchester. But covid-19 and the extreme social-distancing measures used to combat it pose a new and more profound danger to the capital, for they threaten two factors that have been central to its success: fun and foreigners.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon’s triumph is at least partially based on it being a fun place to live. “People come here not only because you can get paid well but because you can have a good time,” says Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy. The bars and cafes of the East End have been an important driver of what Mr McWillams once dubbed the “flat white economy”, where people with interesting hair bounce ideas off each other while drinking trendy beverages.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt is hard to have a flat white economy when you have to maintain two-metre distancing while queuing for your caffeine. Restaurateurs fear that being forced to operate at a lower capacity will drive many of them out of business. Theatres are facing disaster. As a hedge-fund manager puts it, “London without the culture and the restaurants is just a more expensive Frankfurt with more congestion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCovid-19 might combine with Brexit to cut international migration. Although foreign candidates for London jobs will score better on Britain’s new points-based immigration system than those for jobs elsewhere in the country, because the jobs are better paid, the signal has been sent: Britain is not keen on mass immigration. Universities fear that foreign student numbers could fall by 20-50% in the year ahead. For London, with its more than 100,000 foreign students, that is a problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike all great cities, London could also suffer from changing assumptions about work. Many firms now expect that some people will keep working from home even after the danger of coronavirus has receded—if not every day then several days a week. As firms learn to make do with smaller offices, workers might prize bigger homes outside London where they can have an office. The trade-off between space and commuting time looks different if you only have to go in two or three times a week. But if this happens, it will probably benefit commuter towns in the south-east rather than the northern and Midlands towns that Mr Johnson wanted to help.\n</p>\n<p>\nLisa Taylor of Coherent Cities, a consultancy, remains optimistic. “The next two years are going to be very tough,” she argues.“But a different city could emerge on the other side. One where land use has changed, where we have more co-working and co-living spaces.” She reckons that a greener, less congested London could take its inspiration from cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But those are hardly world-beating metropolises.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon is unlikely to slip back into the dismal state it was in before the mid-1980s. It is likely to remain richer and more productive than the rest of Britain. It will remain Europe’s most powerful magnet for talented immigrants. Still, its pulling power is likely to wane. If that happens, Britain’s economy will probably suffer. But a less centralised country, in which opportunity was more evenly distributed, might be a better place in other ways.\n<span>\n■\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\nEditor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of\n</em>\nThe Economist Today\n<em>\n, our daily\n<a href="https://my.economist.com/user#newsletter">\nnewsletter\n</a>\n.

They sat in a circle at a house in the hills a few hours north of San Francisco — where wine country becomes weed country — to discuss the therapeutic potential of CBD, and how to get people to take it seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeveral studies in rodents and in cell cultures had\n<a title href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462008000300015&lng=en&tlng=en">\nsuggested\n</a>\nthat CBD, a nonintoxicating compound from the cannabis plant more formally known as cannabidiol, could protect the nervous system, modulate blood flow, slow the growth of cancer cells and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We were talking about, ‘What can we do with this?’ ” recalled Samantha Miller, who hosted the event at her split-level house, wedged between redwoods and a creek below. A headstrong biochemist, she had been growing marijuana since the age of 14 and had just quit a six-figure job to start her own cannabis testing lab\n<strong>\n.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSamantha Miller at her home in northern California.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA ragtag crew of activists, doctors, writers and marijuana farmers met to discuss the potential of CBD in 2011 at Samantha Miller’s home.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nAfter two years of tracking down high-CBD pot plants and building momentum, the group began to devise ways to persuade more farmers to grow strains with CBD — which had largely been bred out of American pot since it doesn’t get you high. In addition to convincing marijuana dispensaries to widely carry CBD, they wanted to educate the public about its promising benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the group of ten or so brainstormed, a balloon of vaporized pot was passed in one direction and a bong in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There was a strong sense that this was really going to be something, if when people use these strains they have any kind of experience like the mice did in the laboratories,” said Martin Lee, a writer who at the time had been finishing a book\n<a title href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Smoke_Signals.html?id=8XE-AAAAQBAJ">\nabout the social history of marijuana\n</a>\nfor Simon &amp; Schuster.\n</p>\n<p>\nNear him was Stacey Kerr, a physician with flowing silver hair who served as treasurer of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, as well as Wade Laughter, a soft-spoken man in glasses who had started cultivating pot for his glaucoma in the mid-90s. Mr. Laughter and Lawrence Ringo, an old-school hippie grower, were some of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC — the compound that does get you high. Both pledged to keep their strains available for other growers at cheap prices. (Mr. Ringo said he would sell his seeds for as little as $5.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, there was Fred Gardner, a writer who had recruited almost all of these people to the CBD cause. A Harvard-educated former antiwar activist, now 78, Mr. Gardner had been writing about CBD since the late 1990s for publications like Synapse,\n<a title href="https://synapse.library.ucsf.edu/?a=d&d=ucsf19990701-01.2.4&srpos=2&e=-------en--20--1--txt-fred+gardner+gw-----txIN--">\nthe U.C. San Francisco weekly\n</a>\n. For years, he’d been determined to connect the nascent CBD research he heard about at symposiums abroad with the medical marijuana movement in California. And with this group, finally, it seemed to be coming together.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller spent the months after this meeting leading hundreds of CBD seminars for farmers; Dr. Kerr began informal patient surveys to track how CBD made people feel; and as he finished his book, Mr. Lee often traveled around with Mr. Laughter and Mr. Ringo’s high-CBD plants and seeds, spreading the gospel at pot shops across the West.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was aware that this was a pretty special moment,” Dr. Kerr told me, talking about the night at Ms. Miller’s. “That it was the beginning of something big, and we were there to see it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAt the time of Samantha Miller’s summit in 2011\n</strong>\n, THC was the sole chemical “face” of the plant. Cannabis containing significant amounts of CBD was still rare. Police raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana businesses were still common. And because CBD doesn’t get you high, it was easy to miss; hardly anyone outside of pharmaceutical companies and academia had heard of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the nine years since that night in the woods, one of the group’s biggest goals has clearly been accomplished: People know about CBD.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/opinion/24lewis4/merlin_170651910_ce93e3a5-32dd-4c3c-8a14-3e9a5751f199-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nIt has been estimated that the U.S. CBD industry will be worth $16 billion by 2025.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nJennifer Aniston loves beauty products made with it.

That’s because the federal government’s insistence that cannabis has no legitimate use as a medicine created two enormous problems: the proliferation of fake CBD products and the nonsensical separation of CBD from THC.\n</p>\n<p>\nClinical studies\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16209908">\nhave shown\n</a>\nthat CBD is most effective when paired with at least some THC, even if it is not enough to cause a high. However, the United States considers cannabis with THC to be a Schedule 1 drug — which puts it in the same category as heroin, indicating a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This makes further research very difficult to do, and causes sick people in many states to be treated as criminals.\n</p>\n<p>\nCannabis that is high in CBD but extremely low in THC was made legal at the end of 2018. But finding an easy, affordable test that is able to distinguish cannabis with THC from cannabis without THC has been prohibitively difficult\n<a title href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/02/21/hot-hemp-pits-states-against-feds">\nfor farmers\n</a>\nand\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/cbd-thc-cannabis-cannabidiol.html">\ncrime labs\n</a>\nalike. So federal agencies have been\n<a title href="https://hempindustrydaily.com/fda-cbd-regulation-delay-is-costing-profits-and-shelf-space/">\nslow to regulate\n</a>\nthe booming industry — leading to a deluge of tinctures, smoothies and lotions that trusted tests have shown contain no CBD at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the absence of oversight, the push to get more patients access to cannabis medicine — and bona fide CBD — has been co-opted by a push to make as much money as possible off the next big wellness fad. “At a certain point, it had a life of its own,” Ms. Miller told me.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, the CBD industry promises a miracle drug but is often selling a placebo: cannabidiol products with zero cannabidiol inside. As a result, the compound is often caricatured as snake oil, a scam, even as promising research into the full potential of CBD is starting to pick up.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe compound’s reputation is a microcosm of what it means to be in America right now: a thing that some of us consider a hoax and others praise as the solution to everything. But CBD’s rollicking journey from the international underground to cultural ubiquity proves that, as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAs marijuana use increased in the 1960s and ’70s\n</strong>\n, and the Nixon administration criminalized drugs to vilify what\n<a title href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">\none aide described\n</a>\nas “the antiwar left and black people,” the more science-minded side of the government began funding some basic cannabis research. A man named Carlton Turner helped establish the government’s Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi. After that, he became President Ronald Reagan’s drug czar, helping to\n<a title href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-10-26-8603200589-story.html">\nexpand the War on Drugs\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut all the while, Mr. Turner was in touch with a Brazilian scientist named Elisaldo Carlini who had done\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7028792">\nsmall-scale human studies\n</a>\nshowing CBD reduced seizures: “All the early work on CBD was Carlini in Brazil,” Mr. Turner told me this past summer. “We were in communication for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFor decades, Dr. Carlini’s research was not replicated, in part because so few people had access to the compound: Both the pot held at the nation’s sole government-sanctioned marijuana lab at the University of Mississippi and the illegal pot being smoked around the country had only trace CBD content. (Mr. Turner even tested several kinds of cannabis sent by a legendary pot grower, a writer for “High Times” named Mel Frank. To no avail: none of it contained much CBD.)\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nCarlton Turner helped establish the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nThe University of Mississippi\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nIn those years, emissaries of California’s counterculture were often traveling the world looking for unique strains of cannabis. The most influential of these collectors was a man named David Watson. In the early 70s, Mr. Watson sold his possessions and began hitchhiking from Morocco to India, befriending local pot growers along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Watson ultimately settled in Amsterdam to examine his thousands of kinds of cannabis at his own Dutch state-licensed company, HortaPharm BV. He brought in a friend, an American botanist named Robert Connell Clarke to help. When Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke heard about the CBD research Dr. Carlini had done in Brazil, the pair identified and then bred CBD varietals. This led to a discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It attenuates the high,” Mr. Clarke told me over breakfast in Los Angeles. “That came strictly from anecdotal stoner evidence.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA marijuana plant.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nRobert Connell Clarke was an influential collector of unique strains of cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, after multiple sclerosis patients in England became more vocal about how cannabis helped their symptoms, the country allowed a small pharmaceutical company led by a British physician named\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nDr. Geoffrey Guy\n</a>\nto develop plant-derived cannabis medicines; GW Pharmaceuticals\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nlicensed varietals\n</a>\nbred from Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke’s collection of cannabis and got to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Within a couple of years, they figured out a 1:1 combination of a high-THC chemovar and a high-CBD chemovar presented the greatest latitude of effects and prevention of side effects,” said Dr. Ethan Russo, who worked with GW Pharmaceuticals from 1998 to 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke had discovered, having CBD in the mix reduced THC’s more uncomfortable effects: sedation, inebriation, a faster heart rate. And though a few outliers responded well to CBD alone, GW’s data showed that for relieving pain and inflammation, helping with sleep and alleviating seizures and spasms, most patients got the most benefit from an equal mix of CBD and THC — a drug the company called\n<a title href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-feb-01-me-medpot1-story.html">\nSativex\n</a>\n. But the research wasn’t enough. Although the drug has been approved for use in around 30 countries, the F.D.A. has yet to approve Sativex in the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nMr. Gardner, the writer whose CBD advocacy\n</strong>\neventually inspired the 2011 summit\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA copy of O’Shaughnessy’s, the Journal of Cannabis in Clinical Practice, from 2011.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nFred Gardner in his home on March 2, 2020.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nEnter, three years later, one of Oakland’s pioneering pot entrepreneurs, a medical marijuana impresario with pigtail braids named Steve DeAngelo. Mr. DeAngelo, who had been in contact with Mr. Gardner about the urgent need to institute better testing, agreed to help fund a cannabis analysis lab, Steep Hill, which began its operations in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Gardner came by frequently, chatting and checking in to see if Steep Hill’s founders had discovered the elusive compound. And at last, in February 2009 a dual peak on a testing graph appeared, indicating the presence of CBD.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I remember the moment,” said David Lampach, one of the lab’s funders and co-founders. “Seeing the dual peak and realizing it was real, and running it like five times to make sure.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the summer of 2009, the lab had identified five strains with significant CBD and THC. Mr. Gardner was elated, and began referring to his efforts as “Project CBD” alongside other supporters, including Mr. Lee, the writer. “Right away the thought was: ‘What is the government going to say about this? How can they be against something that’s nonintoxicating?’ ” Mr. Lee said.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June of 2010, the host of the 2011 summit, the biochemist Ms. Miller, opened her own lab, Pure Analytics. A few months later, she called Mr. Ringo, the hippie grower, to let him know a pot sample he sent in was a strain with a lot of CBD — as much as 11 percent.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nContainers of a cannabis flower samples at the Steep Hill lab, which began operations in 2008.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA technician macerating cannabis flower samples at Pure Analytics.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n“He’s in the trim room on speaker, and this big whoop goes up,” she said, remembering his staff’s excitement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 2010, a\n<a title href="https://www.projectcbd.org/">\nProject CBD\n</a>\nwebsite was set up where anyone could look through studies organized by disease or condition. Mr. Lee took charge of running it and it began to attract an audience. A few months later, the network of early CBD advocates met up at Ms. Miller’s house in California to coordinate their evangelism. And by the middle of 2011, word of cannabidiol had permeated the population that would become its most potent promotional engine: the chronically ill, people with cancer, with ALS, with serious disorders that weren’t responding to prescription drugs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs stories about CBD’s power spread, demand increased and prices rose. Sick people often relied on the generosity of growers like Mr. Ringo, his son Dakota told me.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nLawrence Ringo in Blocksburg, Calif., about 2010. He was of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKathleen Hart\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n“I’d go up there and see people dying of cancer hanging out with him, and he’d be hooking them up with oil he made in his house,” the younger Mr. Ringo said. Mike Hyde, whose son was suffering from brain cancer, spent months driving around Colorado and the West Coast looking for CBD in late 2011, before connecting with Mr. Ringo at a restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d never met this guy before, and he brought us literally probably $30,000 worth of oil for this CBD that no one could even get,” Mr. Hyde explained. “For free.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCBD’s big launch into the mainstream came when the world saw evidence of what Dr. Carlini had discovered in Brazil, back in the 1970s: the compound’s ability to quell seizures. Unlike a reduction in pain, this was something any politician or camera crew could easily see. It wasn’t a stoner scam.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, in December 2011, an epileptic child used CBD on the Discovery Channel’s “Weed Wars,” a show featuring the co-founder of the Steep Hill lab, Mr. DeAngelo. The following year, the parents of an epileptic boy in San Francisco\n<a title href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/medical-marijuana-epilepsy/">\nbought\n</a>\nCBD from a pot shop. Then, looking for a better quality product, they contacted GW Pharmaceuticals — the British company that had licensed the cannabis collection of those globe-trotting 20th century cannabis collectors, Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke, and which conducted the research in the ’90s that spurred Mr. Gardner’s CBD advocacy. The\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\ncompany developed\n</a>\na 98 percent CBD drug for the boy and others like him.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteve DeAngelo, a pioneering pot entrepreneur.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\n‘Bubba D’ plants in the Clones &amp; Seeds section of Harborside, one of the first dispensary to laboratory test cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nPerhaps the most critical turning point for CBD came in August 2013, when a CNN special hosted by Dr. Sanjay Gupta profiled a 6-year-old girl in Colorado, Charlotte Figi, who used CBD to treat her epilepsy, as well as the brawny brothers who grew her CBD, the Stanleys. Hundreds of families — witnessing the power of CBD enhanced by cable news production values — moved to Colorado to gain access to the Stanleys’ CBD oil, called Charlotte’s Web. The Stanleys told me their wait-list peaked at 15,000 names. And because of public demand, the F.D.A. fast-tracked clinical trials of GW Pharmaceuticals’ 98 percent CBD drug, Epidiolex.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly, everyone wanted CBD, even though no one quite understood it. In the confusion, there was money to be made. Mere weeks after the CNN documentary aired, the spike in CBD interest prompted the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n<a title href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2013/finra-warns-investors-marijuana-stock-scams">\nto issue an investor alert\n</a>\non marijuana stock scams: As the F.D.A. would\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/warning-letters-and-test-results-cannabidiol-related-products">\nlater show\n</a>\n, many online CBD products contained little or no CBD whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIn 2020, CBD is available three ways:\n</strong>\nover the counter; at state-licensed marijuana dispensaries; or if you have certain forms of epilepsy, from GW Pharmaceuticals. Most Americans encounter CBD in the first and most unreliable way — at, say, a bodega in Brooklyn or a health food store in Indiana. A consultant hired to do an investigation by a corporate chain recently told me that the percentage of over-the-counter CBD products that contained the amount on the label was “in the single digits.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs if CBD’s back story couldn’t get any weirder, the path to this glut of phony CBD was paved by, of all people, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnrelated to the brouhaha on the West Coast, tobacco farmers in Kentucky were seeking a new cash crop. In 2011, James Comer won the race for Kentucky state agriculture commissioner by promising to legalize industrial hemp.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That raised a lot of eyebrows, including in McConnell’s office,” Eric Steenstra, a hemp lobbyist, told me. “They saw the winds were shifting.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlong with Representative Jared Polis, now the governor of Colorado, Mr. McConnell included a hemp pilot program in the 2014 farm bill — for “research.” In the legislation, hemp was defined as cannabis containing\n<a title href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/">\nless than 0.3 percent THC\n</a>\n— an arbitrary threshold, not a scientific distinction: Nothing in the Farm Bill, in case law, or in the Controlled Substances Act seemed to say anything about CBD. So entrepreneurs interpreted this research-oriented pilot program as the de facto legalization of cannabidiol.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration disagreed, but couldn’t stop the tidal wave of CBD production. In 2018,\n<a title href="https://www.kyagr.com/marketing/hemp-overview.html">\nover 60 percent\n</a>\nof the hemp crop in Kentucky was grown for CBD. Then, long after the country was already flooded with CBD products both dubious and legitimate, Mr. McConnell inserted language into the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly making hemp\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process">\nfederally legal\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany of the Californians who plotted at Ms. Miller’s house in 2011 have watched in frustration as the CBD industry flourished, divorced from THC, and fake CBD misled consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn his deathbed in 2014, Mr. Ringo insisted to friends and family that the Stanleys used his seeds to develop their famous strain Charlotte’s Web. Joel Stanley told me the genetics for Charlotte’s Web were a “cross of wild hemp with an industry genetic.” Critics of the Stanley brothers in the cannabis industry have grown annoyed by their prominence and push for patents. Their company has been valued at over half a billion dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller, who still runs a cannabis testing lab, told me that in the years since the 2011 summit, she has become disillusioned as people she’d thought had earnest intentions in spreading CBD turned out to just want to get rich. Mr. Gardner feels the same way.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteep Hill provides cannabis testing services to cultivators, processors, dispensaries, collectives and authorized medical cannabis patients.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nThere has been a slight uptick in clinical research around the compound’s relation to anxiety, schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. In September, the National Institutes of Health\n<a title href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-investigate-minor-cannabinoids-terpenes-potential-pain-relieving-properties">\napproved\n</a>\n$3 million in small grants for studies of cannabidiol and other non-THC cannabis compounds. Nevertheless, the government-enabled ham-handed rush to profiteering has seriously, and unduly, undermined CBD’s medical reputation.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven Dr. Turner, Mr. Reagan’s drug czar, said there is far more evidence for the benefits of Sativex, the half-CBD, half-THC drug, than for unregulated CBD online.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There haven’t been enough clinical trials and there never will be,” said Mr. Clarke, the cannabis seed collector. “There’s no vested financial interest in anyone doing it.” Big Pharma is most invested in medications that they can control, that they alone can patent.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill, some of the states with legal cannabis have implemented robust testing standards, and bona fide CBD can be found at many marijuana dispensaries, both on its own and in a variety of ratios with THC. Ms. Miller’s lab, and other responsible actors, are supposed to ensure products that hit legal pot shop shelves contain exactly what they claim to contain. But without stringent federal oversight, few in the CBD business will voluntarily opt-in to tests of their product labeling’s accuracy.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen I asked Dr. Russo, who oversaw much of GW Pharmaceuticals’ research, how he feels about it all, he sighed. “You do something, and other people run with it, and it turns into something else that you don’t recognize,” he said. “I’m always concerned, but what I like to dwell upon is: What is the real potential here?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Chicago Lewis (\n<a title href="https://twitter.com/msamandalewis">\n@msamandalewis\n</a>\n) is an investigative reporter, focusing on drug policy.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I protect myself while flying?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf air travel is unavoidable,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html">\nthere are some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n</a>\nMost important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html">\nnew concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms\n</a>\n. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor.

Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I help?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=7779">\nCharity Navigator\n</a>\n, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I protect myself while flying?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf air travel is unavoidable,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html">\nthere are some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n</a>\nMost important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html">\nnew concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms\n</a>\n. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I get tested?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nthe C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears.\n</a>\nThey will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I help?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=7779">\nCharity Navigator\n</a>\n, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak.

We believe that it is critical to move quickly and define such a standard, thereby freeing up researchers to innovate and diversify at the level of higher level algorithms and graph analytics applications. This effort was inspired by the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) of dense Linear Algebra, and hence our working name for this standard is “the GraphBLAS”.\n</p>\n<p>\nA key insight behind this work is that when a graph is represented by a sparse incidence or adjacency matrix, sparse matrix-vector multiplication is a step of breadth first search.

Poor parts of the Midlands and north of England would get lots of infrastructure investment, helping them to close the productivity gap with London. The country would be “levelled up”.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe idea always seemed a little far-fetched. British governments have been trying to boost productivity outside London for decades, with not much success. And it seems less and less likely that the government will be able to focus on grand new designs as opposed to hasty repair jobs. But something else might happen, to spare Mr Johnson’s blushes. Rather than levelling up, Britain could be about to level down, as London sags.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon was not always the great success it is now. After the second world war the government, which had already pinched the capital with a thick Green Belt, deliberately pushed businesses and citizens out to “new towns” in the Home Counties. Manufacturing declined, as did the docks that had once provided jobs and prosperity. By the 1980s the city’s population had fallen by a quarter from the 8.6m it had hit in 1939. London’s schools and services were famously awful.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the Big Bang deregulated financial services in 1986, the logic of agglomeration reasserted itself and London took off. The creative industries and, in recent years, a thriving tech centre have joined the staples of banking, asset management and business services. Schools, policing and transport have all been transformed. People have flooded in from all continents, making London the world’s most global city.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet some warning signs have been visible for a while. Although London’s population has continued to grow, over the last decade that has been driven by international migration and the birth rate. Between 2008 and 2018, 550,000 more Britons left London than moved to it. People complain of high costs and anxiety. One league table in which London scores poorly is the Office for National Statistics’ rankings of well-being and life satisfaction. Since 2015 migration from the capital has helped reduce the differential between London’s house prices and those in the rest of the country (see chart).\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img src="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200523_BRC642.png">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBut London’s house prices remain double those elsewhere. After housing costs are accounted for Londoners are, on average, worse off than residents of the rest of southern England or Scotland. The chairman of\n<small>\nPWC\n</small>\n, a professional-services firm, has argued that graduates are turning their backs on London. Whereas 60% of graduates working for the big four accounting firms used to be based in the capital, in 2018 60% of new starters were outside.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe London office-cost premium is even higher than the housing-cost one. Prime square footage in the capital costs three times as much as space in other southern cities and seven to nine times as much as elsewhere in Britain. According to a legal recruitment firm, a company can save about £20,000 ($24,500) a year by moving a lawyer out of central London, after office costs and salary are taken into account. “Northshoring”—usually referring, confusingly, to places such as Birmingham that are far from northerly—has become something of a buzzword in the industry.\n<small>\nHSBC\n</small>\nchose to move its British retail banking headquarters to Birmingham in 2017. Amazon, an internet retailer, picked Manchester for its major British corporate site in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the coronavirus crushes property values and office rents, London might become a little less offputting. Perhaps some graduates will be tempted back from Leeds or Manchester. But covid-19 and the extreme social-distancing measures used to combat it pose a new and more profound danger to the capital, for they threaten two factors that have been central to its success: fun and foreigners.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon’s triumph is at least partially based on it being a fun place to live. “People come here not only because you can get paid well but because you can have a good time,” says Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy. The bars and cafes of the East End have been an important driver of what Mr McWillams once dubbed the “flat white economy”, where people with interesting hair bounce ideas off each other while drinking trendy beverages.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt is hard to have a flat white economy when you have to maintain two-metre distancing while queuing for your caffeine. Restaurateurs fear that being forced to operate at a lower capacity will drive many of them out of business. Theatres are facing disaster. As a hedge-fund manager puts it, “London without the culture and the restaurants is just a more expensive Frankfurt with more congestion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCovid-19 might combine with Brexit to cut international migration. Although foreign candidates for London jobs will score better on Britain’s new points-based immigration system than those for jobs elsewhere in the country, because the jobs are better paid, the signal has been sent: Britain is not keen on mass immigration. Universities fear that foreign student numbers could fall by 20-50% in the year ahead. For London, with its more than 100,000 foreign students, that is a problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike all great cities, London could also suffer from changing assumptions about work. Many firms now expect that some people will keep working from home even after the danger of coronavirus has receded—if not every day then several days a week. As firms learn to make do with smaller offices, workers might prize bigger homes outside London where they can have an office. The trade-off between space and commuting time looks different if you only have to go in two or three times a week. But if this happens, it will probably benefit commuter towns in the south-east rather than the northern and Midlands towns that Mr Johnson wanted to help.\n</p>\n<p>\nLisa Taylor of Coherent Cities, a consultancy, remains optimistic. “The next two years are going to be very tough,” she argues.“But a different city could emerge on the other side. One where land use has changed, where we have more co-working and co-living spaces.” She reckons that a greener, less congested London could take its inspiration from cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But those are hardly world-beating metropolises.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon is unlikely to slip back into the dismal state it was in before the mid-1980s. It is likely to remain richer and more productive than the rest of Britain. It will remain Europe’s most powerful magnet for talented immigrants. Still, its pulling power is likely to wane. If that happens, Britain’s economy will probably suffer. But a less centralised country, in which opportunity was more evenly distributed, might be a better place in other ways.\n<span>\n■\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\nEditor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of\n</em>\nThe Economist Today\n<em>\n, our daily\n<a href="https://my.economist.com/user#newsletter">\nnewsletter\n</a>\n.

They sat in a circle at a house in the hills a few hours north of San Francisco — where wine country becomes weed country — to discuss the therapeutic potential of CBD, and how to get people to take it seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeveral studies in rodents and in cell cultures had\n<a title href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462008000300015&lng=en&tlng=en">\nsuggested\n</a>\nthat CBD, a nonintoxicating compound from the cannabis plant more formally known as cannabidiol, could protect the nervous system, modulate blood flow, slow the growth of cancer cells and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We were talking about, ‘What can we do with this?’ ” recalled Samantha Miller, who hosted the event at her split-level house, wedged between redwoods and a creek below. A headstrong biochemist, she had been growing marijuana since the age of 14 and had just quit a six-figure job to start her own cannabis testing lab\n<strong>\n.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSamantha Miller at her home in northern California.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA ragtag crew of activists, doctors, writers and marijuana farmers met to discuss the potential of CBD in 2011 at Samantha Miller’s home.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nAfter two years of tracking down high-CBD pot plants and building momentum, the group began to devise ways to persuade more farmers to grow strains with CBD — which had largely been bred out of American pot since it doesn’t get you high. In addition to convincing marijuana dispensaries to widely carry CBD, they wanted to educate the public about its promising benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the group of ten or so brainstormed, a balloon of vaporized pot was passed in one direction and a bong in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There was a strong sense that this was really going to be something, if when people use these strains they have any kind of experience like the mice did in the laboratories,” said Martin Lee, a writer who at the time had been finishing a book\n<a title href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Smoke_Signals.html?id=8XE-AAAAQBAJ">\nabout the social history of marijuana\n</a>\nfor Simon &amp; Schuster.\n</p>\n<p>\nNear him was Stacey Kerr, a physician with flowing silver hair who served as treasurer of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, as well as Wade Laughter, a soft-spoken man in glasses who had started cultivating pot for his glaucoma in the mid-90s. Mr. Laughter and Lawrence Ringo, an old-school hippie grower, were some of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC — the compound that does get you high. Both pledged to keep their strains available for other growers at cheap prices. (Mr. Ringo said he would sell his seeds for as little as $5.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, there was Fred Gardner, a writer who had recruited almost all of these people to the CBD cause. A Harvard-educated former antiwar activist, now 78, Mr. Gardner had been writing about CBD since the late 1990s for publications like Synapse,\n<a title href="https://synapse.library.ucsf.edu/?a=d&d=ucsf19990701-01.2.4&srpos=2&e=-------en--20--1--txt-fred+gardner+gw-----txIN--">\nthe U.C. San Francisco weekly\n</a>\n. For years, he’d been determined to connect the nascent CBD research he heard about at symposiums abroad with the medical marijuana movement in California. And with this group, finally, it seemed to be coming together.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller spent the months after this meeting leading hundreds of CBD seminars for farmers; Dr. Kerr began informal patient surveys to track how CBD made people feel; and as he finished his book, Mr. Lee often traveled around with Mr. Laughter and Mr. Ringo’s high-CBD plants and seeds, spreading the gospel at pot shops across the West.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was aware that this was a pretty special moment,” Dr. Kerr told me, talking about the night at Ms. Miller’s. “That it was the beginning of something big, and we were there to see it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAt the time of Samantha Miller’s summit in 2011\n</strong>\n, THC was the sole chemical “face” of the plant. Cannabis containing significant amounts of CBD was still rare. Police raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana businesses were still common. And because CBD doesn’t get you high, it was easy to miss; hardly anyone outside of pharmaceutical companies and academia had heard of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the nine years since that night in the woods, one of the group’s biggest goals has clearly been accomplished: People know about CBD.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/opinion/24lewis4/merlin_170651910_ce93e3a5-32dd-4c3c-8a14-3e9a5751f199-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nIt has been estimated that the U.S. CBD industry will be worth $16 billion by 2025.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nJennifer Aniston loves beauty products made with it.

That’s because the federal government’s insistence that cannabis has no legitimate use as a medicine created two enormous problems: the proliferation of fake CBD products and the nonsensical separation of CBD from THC.\n</p>\n<p>\nClinical studies\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16209908">\nhave shown\n</a>\nthat CBD is most effective when paired with at least some THC, even if it is not enough to cause a high. However, the United States considers cannabis with THC to be a Schedule 1 drug — which puts it in the same category as heroin, indicating a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This makes further research very difficult to do, and causes sick people in many states to be treated as criminals.\n</p>\n<p>\nCannabis that is high in CBD but extremely low in THC was made legal at the end of 2018. But finding an easy, affordable test that is able to distinguish cannabis with THC from cannabis without THC has been prohibitively difficult\n<a title href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/02/21/hot-hemp-pits-states-against-feds">\nfor farmers\n</a>\nand\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/cbd-thc-cannabis-cannabidiol.html">\ncrime labs\n</a>\nalike. So federal agencies have been\n<a title href="https://hempindustrydaily.com/fda-cbd-regulation-delay-is-costing-profits-and-shelf-space/">\nslow to regulate\n</a>\nthe booming industry — leading to a deluge of tinctures, smoothies and lotions that trusted tests have shown contain no CBD at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the absence of oversight, the push to get more patients access to cannabis medicine — and bona fide CBD — has been co-opted by a push to make as much money as possible off the next big wellness fad. “At a certain point, it had a life of its own,” Ms. Miller told me.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, the CBD industry promises a miracle drug but is often selling a placebo: cannabidiol products with zero cannabidiol inside. As a result, the compound is often caricatured as snake oil, a scam, even as promising research into the full potential of CBD is starting to pick up.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe compound’s reputation is a microcosm of what it means to be in America right now: a thing that some of us consider a hoax and others praise as the solution to everything. But CBD’s rollicking journey from the international underground to cultural ubiquity proves that, as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAs marijuana use increased in the 1960s and ’70s\n</strong>\n, and the Nixon administration criminalized drugs to vilify what\n<a title href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">\none aide described\n</a>\nas “the antiwar left and black people,” the more science-minded side of the government began funding some basic cannabis research. A man named Carlton Turner helped establish the government’s Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi. After that, he became President Ronald Reagan’s drug czar, helping to\n<a title href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-10-26-8603200589-story.html">\nexpand the War on Drugs\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut all the while, Mr. Turner was in touch with a Brazilian scientist named Elisaldo Carlini who had done\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7028792">\nsmall-scale human studies\n</a>\nshowing CBD reduced seizures: “All the early work on CBD was Carlini in Brazil,” Mr. Turner told me this past summer. “We were in communication for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFor decades, Dr. Carlini’s research was not replicated, in part because so few people had access to the compound: Both the pot held at the nation’s sole government-sanctioned marijuana lab at the University of Mississippi and the illegal pot being smoked around the country had only trace CBD content. (Mr. Turner even tested several kinds of cannabis sent by a legendary pot grower, a writer for “High Times” named Mel Frank. To no avail: none of it contained much CBD.)\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nCarlton Turner helped establish the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nThe University of Mississippi\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nIn those years, emissaries of California’s counterculture were often traveling the world looking for unique strains of cannabis. The most influential of these collectors was a man named David Watson. In the early 70s, Mr. Watson sold his possessions and began hitchhiking from Morocco to India, befriending local pot growers along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Watson ultimately settled in Amsterdam to examine his thousands of kinds of cannabis at his own Dutch state-licensed company, HortaPharm BV. He brought in a friend, an American botanist named Robert Connell Clarke to help. When Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke heard about the CBD research Dr. Carlini had done in Brazil, the pair identified and then bred CBD varietals. This led to a discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It attenuates the high,” Mr. Clarke told me over breakfast in Los Angeles. “That came strictly from anecdotal stoner evidence.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA marijuana plant.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nRobert Connell Clarke was an influential collector of unique strains of cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, after multiple sclerosis patients in England became more vocal about how cannabis helped their symptoms, the country allowed a small pharmaceutical company led by a British physician named\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nDr. Geoffrey Guy\n</a>\nto develop plant-derived cannabis medicines; GW Pharmaceuticals\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nlicensed varietals\n</a>\nbred from Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke’s collection of cannabis and got to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Within a couple of years, they figured out a 1:1 combination of a high-THC chemovar and a high-CBD chemovar presented the greatest latitude of effects and prevention of side effects,” said Dr. Ethan Russo, who worked with GW Pharmaceuticals from 1998 to 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke had discovered, having CBD in the mix reduced THC’s more uncomfortable effects: sedation, inebriation, a faster heart rate. And though a few outliers responded well to CBD alone, GW’s data showed that for relieving pain and inflammation, helping with sleep and alleviating seizures and spasms, most patients got the most benefit from an equal mix of CBD and THC — a drug the company called\n<a title href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-feb-01-me-medpot1-story.html">\nSativex\n</a>\n. But the research wasn’t enough.

Mr. DeAngelo, who had been in contact with Mr. Gardner about the urgent need to institute better testing, agreed to help fund a cannabis analysis lab, Steep Hill, which began its operations in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Gardner came by frequently, chatting and checking in to see if Steep Hill’s founders had discovered the elusive compound. And at last, in February 2009 a dual peak on a testing graph appeared, indicating the presence of CBD.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I remember the moment,” said David Lampach, one of the lab’s funders and co-founders. “Seeing the dual peak and realizing it was real, and running it like five times to make sure.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the summer of 2009, the lab had identified five strains with significant CBD and THC. Mr. Gardner was elated, and began referring to his efforts as “Project CBD” alongside other supporters, including Mr. Lee, the writer. “Right away the thought was: ‘What is the government going to say about this? How can they be against something that’s nonintoxicating?’ ” Mr. Lee said.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June of 2010, the host of the 2011 summit, the biochemist Ms. Miller, opened her own lab, Pure Analytics. A few months later, she called Mr. Ringo, the hippie grower, to let him know a pot sample he sent in was a strain with a lot of CBD — as much as 11 percent.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nContainers of a cannabis flower samples at the Steep Hill lab, which began operations in 2008.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA technician macerating cannabis flower samples at Pure Analytics.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n“He’s in the trim room on speaker, and this big whoop goes up,” she said, remembering his staff’s excitement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 2010, a\n<a title href="https://www.projectcbd.org/">\nProject CBD\n</a>\nwebsite was set up where anyone could look through studies organized by disease or condition. Mr. Lee took charge of running it and it began to attract an audience. A few months later, the network of early CBD advocates met up at Ms. Miller’s house in California to coordinate their evangelism. And by the middle of 2011, word of cannabidiol had permeated the population that would become its most potent promotional engine: the chronically ill, people with cancer, with ALS, with serious disorders that weren’t responding to prescription drugs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs stories about CBD’s power spread, demand increased and prices rose. Sick people often relied on the generosity of growers like Mr. Ringo, his son Dakota told me.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nLawrence Ringo in Blocksburg, Calif., about 2010. He was of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKathleen Hart\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n“I’d go up there and see people dying of cancer hanging out with him, and he’d be hooking them up with oil he made in his house,” the younger Mr. Ringo said. Mike Hyde, whose son was suffering from brain cancer, spent months driving around Colorado and the West Coast looking for CBD in late 2011, before connecting with Mr. Ringo at a restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d never met this guy before, and he brought us literally probably $30,000 worth of oil for this CBD that no one could even get,” Mr. Hyde explained. “For free.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCBD’s big launch into the mainstream came when the world saw evidence of what Dr. Carlini had discovered in Brazil, back in the 1970s: the compound’s ability to quell seizures. Unlike a reduction in pain, this was something any politician or camera crew could easily see. It wasn’t a stoner scam.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, in December 2011, an epileptic child used CBD on the Discovery Channel’s “Weed Wars,” a show featuring the co-founder of the Steep Hill lab, Mr. DeAngelo. The following year, the parents of an epileptic boy in San Francisco\n<a title href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/medical-marijuana-epilepsy/">\nbought\n</a>\nCBD from a pot shop. Then, looking for a better quality product, they contacted GW Pharmaceuticals — the British company that had licensed the cannabis collection of those globe-trotting 20th century cannabis collectors, Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke, and which conducted the research in the ’90s that spurred Mr. Gardner’s CBD advocacy. The\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\ncompany developed\n</a>\na 98 percent CBD drug for the boy and others like him.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteve DeAngelo, a pioneering pot entrepreneur.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\n‘Bubba D’ plants in the Clones &amp; Seeds section of Harborside, one of the first dispensary to laboratory test cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nPerhaps the most critical turning point for CBD came in August 2013, when a CNN special hosted by Dr. Sanjay Gupta profiled a 6-year-old girl in Colorado, Charlotte Figi, who used CBD to treat her epilepsy, as well as the brawny brothers who grew her CBD, the Stanleys. Hundreds of families — witnessing the power of CBD enhanced by cable news production values — moved to Colorado to gain access to the Stanleys’ CBD oil, called Charlotte’s Web. The Stanleys told me their wait-list peaked at 15,000 names. And because of public demand, the F.D.A. fast-tracked clinical trials of GW Pharmaceuticals’ 98 percent CBD drug, Epidiolex.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly, everyone wanted CBD, even though no one quite understood it. In the confusion, there was money to be made. Mere weeks after the CNN documentary aired, the spike in CBD interest prompted the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n<a title href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2013/finra-warns-investors-marijuana-stock-scams">\nto issue an investor alert\n</a>\non marijuana stock scams: As the F.D.A. would\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/warning-letters-and-test-results-cannabidiol-related-products">\nlater show\n</a>\n, many online CBD products contained little or no CBD whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIn 2020, CBD is available three ways:\n</strong>\nover the counter; at state-licensed marijuana dispensaries; or if you have certain forms of epilepsy, from GW Pharmaceuticals. Most Americans encounter CBD in the first and most unreliable way — at, say, a bodega in Brooklyn or a health food store in Indiana. A consultant hired to do an investigation by a corporate chain recently told me that the percentage of over-the-counter CBD products that contained the amount on the label was “in the single digits.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs if CBD’s back story couldn’t get any weirder, the path to this glut of phony CBD was paved by, of all people, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnrelated to the brouhaha on the West Coast, tobacco farmers in Kentucky were seeking a new cash crop. In 2011, James Comer won the race for Kentucky state agriculture commissioner by promising to legalize industrial hemp.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That raised a lot of eyebrows, including in McConnell’s office,” Eric Steenstra, a hemp lobbyist, told me. “They saw the winds were shifting.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlong with Representative Jared Polis, now the governor of Colorado, Mr. McConnell included a hemp pilot program in the 2014 farm bill — for “research.” In the legislation, hemp was defined as cannabis containing\n<a title href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/">\nless than 0.3 percent THC\n</a>\n— an arbitrary threshold, not a scientific distinction: Nothing in the Farm Bill, in case law, or in the Controlled Substances Act seemed to say anything about CBD. So entrepreneurs interpreted this research-oriented pilot program as the de facto legalization of cannabidiol.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration disagreed, but couldn’t stop the tidal wave of CBD production. In 2018,\n<a title href="https://www.kyagr.com/marketing/hemp-overview.html">\nover 60 percent\n</a>\nof the hemp crop in Kentucky was grown for CBD. Then, long after the country was already flooded with CBD products both dubious and legitimate, Mr. McConnell inserted language into the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly making hemp\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process">\nfederally legal\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany of the Californians who plotted at Ms. Miller’s house in 2011 have watched in frustration as the CBD industry flourished, divorced from THC, and fake CBD misled consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn his deathbed in 2014, Mr. Ringo insisted to friends and family that the Stanleys used his seeds to develop their famous strain Charlotte’s Web. Joel Stanley told me the genetics for Charlotte’s Web were a “cross of wild hemp with an industry genetic.” Critics of the Stanley brothers in the cannabis industry have grown annoyed by their prominence and push for patents. Their company has been valued at over half a billion dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller, who still runs a cannabis testing lab, told me that in the years since the 2011 summit, she has become disillusioned as people she’d thought had earnest intentions in spreading CBD turned out to just want to get rich. Mr. Gardner feels the same way.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteep Hill provides cannabis testing services to cultivators, processors, dispensaries, collectives and authorized medical cannabis patients.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nThere has been a slight uptick in clinical research around the compound’s relation to anxiety, schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. In September, the National Institutes of Health\n<a title href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-investigate-minor-cannabinoids-terpenes-potential-pain-relieving-properties">\napproved\n</a>\n$3 million in small grants for studies of cannabidiol and other non-THC cannabis compounds. Nevertheless, the government-enabled ham-handed rush to profiteering has seriously, and unduly, undermined CBD’s medical reputation.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven Dr. Turner, Mr. Reagan’s drug czar, said there is far more evidence for the benefits of Sativex, the half-CBD, half-THC drug, than for unregulated CBD online.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There haven’t been enough clinical trials and there never will be,” said Mr. Clarke, the cannabis seed collector. “There’s no vested financial interest in anyone doing it.” Big Pharma is most invested in medications that they can control, that they alone can patent.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill, some of the states with legal cannabis have implemented robust testing standards, and bona fide CBD can be found at many marijuana dispensaries, both on its own and in a variety of ratios with THC. Ms. Miller’s lab, and other responsible actors, are supposed to ensure products that hit legal pot shop shelves contain exactly what they claim to contain. But without stringent federal oversight, few in the CBD business will voluntarily opt-in to tests of their product labeling’s accuracy.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen I asked Dr. Russo, who oversaw much of GW Pharmaceuticals’ research, how he feels about it all, he sighed. “You do something, and other people run with it, and it turns into something else that you don’t recognize,” he said. “I’m always concerned, but what I like to dwell upon is: What is the real potential here?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Chicago Lewis (\n<a title href="https://twitter.com/msamandalewis">\n@msamandalewis\n</a>\n) is an investigative reporter, focusing on drug policy.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners.

If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people.

We believe that it is critical to move quickly and define such a standard, thereby freeing up researchers to innovate and diversify at the level of higher level algorithms and graph analytics applications. This effort was inspired by the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) of dense Linear Algebra, and hence our working name for this standard is “the GraphBLAS”.\n</p>\n<p>\nA key insight behind this work is that when a graph is represented by a sparse incidence or adjacency matrix, sparse matrix-vector multiplication is a step of breadth first search. By generalizing the pair of scalar operations involved in the linear algebra computations to define a semiring, we can extend the range of these primitives to support a wide range of parallel graph algorithms.\n</p>\n<h1>\n<span>\nMore information\n</span>\n</h1>\n<p>\nA C reference implementation, SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS, can be downloaded from\n<a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur 2013 manifesto for this project can be found\n<a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/PAPERS/GraphPrimitives-HPEC.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe mathematical definition of the GraphBLAS can be found\n<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kepner/GraphBLAS/GraphBLAS-Math-release.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBackground information about graphs in the language of linear algebra can be found in the book:\n<a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/se22/">\nGraph Algorithms in the Language of Linear Algebra\n</a>\n, edited by J.

Poor parts of the Midlands and north of England would get lots of infrastructure investment, helping them to close the productivity gap with London. The country would be “levelled up”.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe idea always seemed a little far-fetched. British governments have been trying to boost productivity outside London for decades, with not much success. And it seems less and less likely that the government will be able to focus on grand new designs as opposed to hasty repair jobs. But something else might happen, to spare Mr Johnson’s blushes. Rather than levelling up, Britain could be about to level down, as London sags.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon was not always the great success it is now. After the second world war the government, which had already pinched the capital with a thick Green Belt, deliberately pushed businesses and citizens out to “new towns” in the Home Counties. Manufacturing declined, as did the docks that had once provided jobs and prosperity. By the 1980s the city’s population had fallen by a quarter from the 8.6m it had hit in 1939. London’s schools and services were famously awful.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the Big Bang deregulated financial services in 1986, the logic of agglomeration reasserted itself and London took off. The creative industries and, in recent years, a thriving tech centre have joined the staples of banking, asset management and business services. Schools, policing and transport have all been transformed. People have flooded in from all continents, making London the world’s most global city.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet some warning signs have been visible for a while. Although London’s population has continued to grow, over the last decade that has been driven by international migration and the birth rate. Between 2008 and 2018, 550,000 more Britons left London than moved to it. People complain of high costs and anxiety. One league table in which London scores poorly is the Office for National Statistics’ rankings of well-being and life satisfaction. Since 2015 migration from the capital has helped reduce the differential between London’s house prices and those in the rest of the country (see chart).\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img src="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200523_BRC642.png">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBut London’s house prices remain double those elsewhere. After housing costs are accounted for Londoners are, on average, worse off than residents of the rest of southern England or Scotland. The chairman of\n<small>\nPWC\n</small>\n, a professional-services firm, has argued that graduates are turning their backs on London. Whereas 60% of graduates working for the big four accounting firms used to be based in the capital, in 2018 60% of new starters were outside.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe London office-cost premium is even higher than the housing-cost one. Prime square footage in the capital costs three times as much as space in other southern cities and seven to nine times as much as elsewhere in Britain. According to a legal recruitment firm, a company can save about £20,000 ($24,500) a year by moving a lawyer out of central London, after office costs and salary are taken into account. “Northshoring”—usually referring, confusingly, to places such as Birmingham that are far from northerly—has become something of a buzzword in the industry.\n<small>\nHSBC\n</small>\nchose to move its British retail banking headquarters to Birmingham in 2017. Amazon, an internet retailer, picked Manchester for its major British corporate site in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the coronavirus crushes property values and office rents, London might become a little less offputting. Perhaps some graduates will be tempted back from Leeds or Manchester. But covid-19 and the extreme social-distancing measures used to combat it pose a new and more profound danger to the capital, for they threaten two factors that have been central to its success: fun and foreigners.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon’s triumph is at least partially based on it being a fun place to live. “People come here not only because you can get paid well but because you can have a good time,” says Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy. The bars and cafes of the East End have been an important driver of what Mr McWillams once dubbed the “flat white economy”, where people with interesting hair bounce ideas off each other while drinking trendy beverages.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt is hard to have a flat white economy when you have to maintain two-metre distancing while queuing for your caffeine. Restaurateurs fear that being forced to operate at a lower capacity will drive many of them out of business. Theatres are facing disaster. As a hedge-fund manager puts it, “London without the culture and the restaurants is just a more expensive Frankfurt with more congestion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCovid-19 might combine with Brexit to cut international migration. Although foreign candidates for London jobs will score better on Britain’s new points-based immigration system than those for jobs elsewhere in the country, because the jobs are better paid, the signal has been sent: Britain is not keen on mass immigration. Universities fear that foreign student numbers could fall by 20-50% in the year ahead. For London, with its more than 100,000 foreign students, that is a problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike all great cities, London could also suffer from changing assumptions about work. Many firms now expect that some people will keep working from home even after the danger of coronavirus has receded—if not every day then several days a week. As firms learn to make do with smaller offices, workers might prize bigger homes outside London where they can have an office. The trade-off between space and commuting time looks different if you only have to go in two or three times a week. But if this happens, it will probably benefit commuter towns in the south-east rather than the northern and Midlands towns that Mr Johnson wanted to help.\n</p>\n<p>\nLisa Taylor of Coherent Cities, a consultancy, remains optimistic. “The next two years are going to be very tough,” she argues.“But a different city could emerge on the other side. One where land use has changed, where we have more co-working and co-living spaces.” She reckons that a greener, less congested London could take its inspiration from cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But those are hardly world-beating metropolises.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon is unlikely to slip back into the dismal state it was in before the mid-1980s. It is likely to remain richer and more productive than the rest of Britain. It will remain Europe’s most powerful magnet for talented immigrants. Still, its pulling power is likely to wane. If that happens, Britain’s economy will probably suffer.

They sat in a circle at a house in the hills a few hours north of San Francisco — where wine country becomes weed country — to discuss the therapeutic potential of CBD, and how to get people to take it seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeveral studies in rodents and in cell cultures had\n<a title href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462008000300015&lng=en&tlng=en">\nsuggested\n</a>\nthat CBD, a nonintoxicating compound from the cannabis plant more formally known as cannabidiol, could protect the nervous system, modulate blood flow, slow the growth of cancer cells and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We were talking about, ‘What can we do with this?’ ” recalled Samantha Miller, who hosted the event at her split-level house, wedged between redwoods and a creek below. A headstrong biochemist, she had been growing marijuana since the age of 14 and had just quit a six-figure job to start her own cannabis testing lab\n<strong>\n.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSamantha Miller at her home in northern California.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA ragtag crew of activists, doctors, writers and marijuana farmers met to discuss the potential of CBD in 2011 at Samantha Miller’s home.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nAfter two years of tracking down high-CBD pot plants and building momentum, the group began to devise ways to persuade more farmers to grow strains with CBD — which had largely been bred out of American pot since it doesn’t get you high. In addition to convincing marijuana dispensaries to widely carry CBD, they wanted to educate the public about its promising benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the group of ten or so brainstormed, a balloon of vaporized pot was passed in one direction and a bong in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There was a strong sense that this was really going to be something, if when people use these strains they have any kind of experience like the mice did in the laboratories,” said Martin Lee, a writer who at the time had been finishing a book\n<a title href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Smoke_Signals.html?id=8XE-AAAAQBAJ">\nabout the social history of marijuana\n</a>\nfor Simon &amp; Schuster.\n</p>\n<p>\nNear him was Stacey Kerr, a physician with flowing silver hair who served as treasurer of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, as well as Wade Laughter, a soft-spoken man in glasses who had started cultivating pot for his glaucoma in the mid-90s. Mr. Laughter and Lawrence Ringo, an old-school hippie grower, were some of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC — the compound that does get you high. Both pledged to keep their strains available for other growers at cheap prices. (Mr. Ringo said he would sell his seeds for as little as $5.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, there was Fred Gardner, a writer who had recruited almost all of these people to the CBD cause. A Harvard-educated former antiwar activist, now 78, Mr. Gardner had been writing about CBD since the late 1990s for publications like Synapse,\n<a title href="https://synapse.library.ucsf.edu/?a=d&d=ucsf19990701-01.2.4&srpos=2&e=-------en--20--1--txt-fred+gardner+gw-----txIN--">\nthe U.C. San Francisco weekly\n</a>\n. For years, he’d been determined to connect the nascent CBD research he heard about at symposiums abroad with the medical marijuana movement in California. And with this group, finally, it seemed to be coming together.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller spent the months after this meeting leading hundreds of CBD seminars for farmers; Dr. Kerr began informal patient surveys to track how CBD made people feel; and as he finished his book, Mr. Lee often traveled around with Mr. Laughter and Mr. Ringo’s high-CBD plants and seeds, spreading the gospel at pot shops across the West.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was aware that this was a pretty special moment,” Dr. Kerr told me, talking about the night at Ms. Miller’s. “That it was the beginning of something big, and we were there to see it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAt the time of Samantha Miller’s summit in 2011\n</strong>\n, THC was the sole chemical “face” of the plant. Cannabis containing significant amounts of CBD was still rare. Police raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana businesses were still common. And because CBD doesn’t get you high, it was easy to miss; hardly anyone outside of pharmaceutical companies and academia had heard of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the nine years since that night in the woods, one of the group’s biggest goals has clearly been accomplished: People know about CBD.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/opinion/24lewis4/merlin_170651910_ce93e3a5-32dd-4c3c-8a14-3e9a5751f199-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nIt has been estimated that the U.S. CBD industry will be worth $16 billion by 2025.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nJennifer Aniston loves beauty products made with it.

And e-commerce sales of CBD\n<a title href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/cbd-e-commerce-sales-are-booming-with-the-world-battling-covid-19-2020-04-06-71975826?mod=mw_quote_news">\nhave grown\n</a>\nthis year amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the CBD landscape of 2020 looks nothing like what the activists and scientists intended. That’s because the federal government’s insistence that cannabis has no legitimate use as a medicine created two enormous problems: the proliferation of fake CBD products and the nonsensical separation of CBD from THC.\n</p>\n<p>\nClinical studies\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16209908">\nhave shown\n</a>\nthat CBD is most effective when paired with at least some THC, even if it is not enough to cause a high. However, the United States considers cannabis with THC to be a Schedule 1 drug — which puts it in the same category as heroin, indicating a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This makes further research very difficult to do, and causes sick people in many states to be treated as criminals.\n</p>\n<p>\nCannabis that is high in CBD but extremely low in THC was made legal at the end of 2018. But finding an easy, affordable test that is able to distinguish cannabis with THC from cannabis without THC has been prohibitively difficult\n<a title href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/02/21/hot-hemp-pits-states-against-feds">\nfor farmers\n</a>\nand\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/cbd-thc-cannabis-cannabidiol.html">\ncrime labs\n</a>\nalike. So federal agencies have been\n<a title href="https://hempindustrydaily.com/fda-cbd-regulation-delay-is-costing-profits-and-shelf-space/">\nslow to regulate\n</a>\nthe booming industry — leading to a deluge of tinctures, smoothies and lotions that trusted tests have shown contain no CBD at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the absence of oversight, the push to get more patients access to cannabis medicine — and bona fide CBD — has been co-opted by a push to make as much money as possible off the next big wellness fad. “At a certain point, it had a life of its own,” Ms. Miller told me.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, the CBD industry promises a miracle drug but is often selling a placebo: cannabidiol products with zero cannabidiol inside. As a result, the compound is often caricatured as snake oil, a scam, even as promising research into the full potential of CBD is starting to pick up.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe compound’s reputation is a microcosm of what it means to be in America right now: a thing that some of us consider a hoax and others praise as the solution to everything. But CBD’s rollicking journey from the international underground to cultural ubiquity proves that, as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAs marijuana use increased in the 1960s and ’70s\n</strong>\n, and the Nixon administration criminalized drugs to vilify what\n<a title href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">\none aide described\n</a>\nas “the antiwar left and black people,” the more science-minded side of the government began funding some basic cannabis research. A man named Carlton Turner helped establish the government’s Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi. After that, he became President Ronald Reagan’s drug czar, helping to\n<a title href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-10-26-8603200589-story.html">\nexpand the War on Drugs\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut all the while, Mr. Turner was in touch with a Brazilian scientist named Elisaldo Carlini who had done\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7028792">\nsmall-scale human studies\n</a>\nshowing CBD reduced seizures: “All the early work on CBD was Carlini in Brazil,” Mr. Turner told me this past summer. “We were in communication for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFor decades, Dr. Carlini’s research was not replicated, in part because so few people had access to the compound: Both the pot held at the nation’s sole government-sanctioned marijuana lab at the University of Mississippi and the illegal pot being smoked around the country had only trace CBD content. (Mr. Turner even tested several kinds of cannabis sent by a legendary pot grower, a writer for “High Times” named Mel Frank. To no avail: none of it contained much CBD.)\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nCarlton Turner helped establish the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nThe University of Mississippi\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nIn those years, emissaries of California’s counterculture were often traveling the world looking for unique strains of cannabis. The most influential of these collectors was a man named David Watson. In the early 70s, Mr. Watson sold his possessions and began hitchhiking from Morocco to India, befriending local pot growers along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Watson ultimately settled in Amsterdam to examine his thousands of kinds of cannabis at his own Dutch state-licensed company, HortaPharm BV. He brought in a friend, an American botanist named Robert Connell Clarke to help. When Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke heard about the CBD research Dr. Carlini had done in Brazil, the pair identified and then bred CBD varietals. This led to a discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It attenuates the high,” Mr. Clarke told me over breakfast in Los Angeles. “That came strictly from anecdotal stoner evidence.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA marijuana plant.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nRobert Connell Clarke was an influential collector of unique strains of cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, after multiple sclerosis patients in England became more vocal about how cannabis helped their symptoms, the country allowed a small pharmaceutical company led by a British physician named\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nDr. Geoffrey Guy\n</a>\nto develop plant-derived cannabis medicines; GW Pharmaceuticals\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nlicensed varietals\n</a>\nbred from Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke’s collection of cannabis and got to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Within a couple of years, they figured out a 1:1 combination of a high-THC chemovar and a high-CBD chemovar presented the greatest latitude of effects and prevention of side effects,” said Dr. Ethan Russo, who worked with GW Pharmaceuticals from 1998 to 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke had discovered, having CBD in the mix reduced THC’s more uncomfortable effects: sedation, inebriation, a faster heart rate. And though a few outliers responded well to CBD alone, GW’s data showed that for relieving pain and inflammation, helping with sleep and alleviating seizures and spasms, most patients got the most benefit from an equal mix of CBD and THC — a drug the company called\n<a title href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-feb-01-me-medpot1-story.html">\nSativex\n</a>\n. But the research wasn’t enough. Although the drug has been approved for use in around 30 countries, the F.D.A. has yet to approve Sativex in the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nMr. Gardner, the writer whose CBD advocacy\n</strong>\neventually inspired the 2011 summit\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA copy of O’Shaughnessy’s, the Journal of Cannabis in Clinical Practice, from 2011.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nFred Gardner in his home on March 2, 2020.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nEnter, three years later, one of Oakland’s pioneering pot entrepreneurs, a medical marijuana impresario with pigtail braids named Steve DeAngelo. Mr. DeAngelo, who had been in contact with Mr. Gardner about the urgent need to institute better testing, agreed to help fund a cannabis analysis lab, Steep Hill, which began its operations in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Gardner came by frequently, chatting and checking in to see if Steep Hill’s founders had discovered the elusive compound. And at last, in February 2009 a dual peak on a testing graph appeared, indicating the presence of CBD.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I remember the moment,” said David Lampach, one of the lab’s funders and co-founders. “Seeing the dual peak and realizing it was real, and running it like five times to make sure.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the summer of 2009, the lab had identified five strains with significant CBD and THC. Mr. Gardner was elated, and began referring to his efforts as “Project CBD” alongside other supporters, including Mr. Lee, the writer. “Right away the thought was: ‘What is the government going to say about this? How can they be against something that’s nonintoxicating?’ ” Mr. Lee said.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June of 2010, the host of the 2011 summit, the biochemist Ms. Miller, opened her own lab, Pure Analytics. A few months later, she called Mr. Ringo, the hippie grower, to let him know a pot sample he sent in was a strain with a lot of CBD — as much as 11 percent.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nContainers of a cannabis flower samples at the Steep Hill lab, which began operations in 2008.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA technician macerating cannabis flower samples at Pure Analytics.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n“He’s in the trim room on speaker, and this big whoop goes up,” she said, remembering his staff’s excitement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 2010, a\n<a title href="https://www.projectcbd.org/">\nProject CBD\n</a>\nwebsite was set up where anyone could look through studies organized by disease or condition. Mr. Lee took charge of running it and it began to attract an audience. A few months later, the network of early CBD advocates met up at Ms. Miller’s house in California to coordinate their evangelism. And by the middle of 2011, word of cannabidiol had permeated the population that would become its most potent promotional engine: the chronically ill, people with cancer, with ALS, with serious disorders that weren’t responding to prescription drugs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs stories about CBD’s power spread, demand increased and prices rose. Sick people often relied on the generosity of growers like Mr. Ringo, his son Dakota told me.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nLawrence Ringo in Blocksburg, Calif., about 2010. He was of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKathleen Hart\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n“I’d go up there and see people dying of cancer hanging out with him, and he’d be hooking them up with oil he made in his house,” the younger Mr. Ringo said. Mike Hyde, whose son was suffering from brain cancer, spent months driving around Colorado and the West Coast looking for CBD in late 2011, before connecting with Mr. Ringo at a restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d never met this guy before, and he brought us literally probably $30,000 worth of oil for this CBD that no one could even get,” Mr. Hyde explained. “For free.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCBD’s big launch into the mainstream came when the world saw evidence of what Dr. Carlini had discovered in Brazil, back in the 1970s: the compound’s ability to quell seizures. Unlike a reduction in pain, this was something any politician or camera crew could easily see. It wasn’t a stoner scam.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, in December 2011, an epileptic child used CBD on the Discovery Channel’s “Weed Wars,” a show featuring the co-founder of the Steep Hill lab, Mr. DeAngelo. The following year, the parents of an epileptic boy in San Francisco\n<a title href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/medical-marijuana-epilepsy/">\nbought\n</a>\nCBD from a pot shop. Then, looking for a better quality product, they contacted GW Pharmaceuticals — the British company that had licensed the cannabis collection of those globe-trotting 20th century cannabis collectors, Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke, and which conducted the research in the ’90s that spurred Mr. Gardner’s CBD advocacy. The\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\ncompany developed\n</a>\na 98 percent CBD drug for the boy and others like him.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteve DeAngelo, a pioneering pot entrepreneur.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\n‘Bubba D’ plants in the Clones &amp; Seeds section of Harborside, one of the first dispensary to laboratory test cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nPerhaps the most critical turning point for CBD came in August 2013, when a CNN special hosted by Dr. Sanjay Gupta profiled a 6-year-old girl in Colorado, Charlotte Figi, who used CBD to treat her epilepsy, as well as the brawny brothers who grew her CBD, the Stanleys. Hundreds of families — witnessing the power of CBD enhanced by cable news production values — moved to Colorado to gain access to the Stanleys’ CBD oil, called Charlotte’s Web. The Stanleys told me their wait-list peaked at 15,000 names. And because of public demand, the F.D.A. fast-tracked clinical trials of GW Pharmaceuticals’ 98 percent CBD drug, Epidiolex.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly, everyone wanted CBD, even though no one quite understood it. In the confusion, there was money to be made. Mere weeks after the CNN documentary aired, the spike in CBD interest prompted the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n<a title href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2013/finra-warns-investors-marijuana-stock-scams">\nto issue an investor alert\n</a>\non marijuana stock scams: As the F.D.A. would\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/warning-letters-and-test-results-cannabidiol-related-products">\nlater show\n</a>\n, many online CBD products contained little or no CBD whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIn 2020, CBD is available three ways:\n</strong>\nover the counter; at state-licensed marijuana dispensaries; or if you have certain forms of epilepsy, from GW Pharmaceuticals. Most Americans encounter CBD in the first and most unreliable way — at, say, a bodega in Brooklyn or a health food store in Indiana. A consultant hired to do an investigation by a corporate chain recently told me that the percentage of over-the-counter CBD products that contained the amount on the label was “in the single digits.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs if CBD’s back story couldn’t get any weirder, the path to this glut of phony CBD was paved by, of all people, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnrelated to the brouhaha on the West Coast, tobacco farmers in Kentucky were seeking a new cash crop. In 2011, James Comer won the race for Kentucky state agriculture commissioner by promising to legalize industrial hemp.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That raised a lot of eyebrows, including in McConnell’s office,” Eric Steenstra, a hemp lobbyist, told me. “They saw the winds were shifting.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlong with Representative Jared Polis, now the governor of Colorado, Mr. McConnell included a hemp pilot program in the 2014 farm bill — for “research.” In the legislation, hemp was defined as cannabis containing\n<a title href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/">\nless than 0.3 percent THC\n</a>\n— an arbitrary threshold, not a scientific distinction: Nothing in the Farm Bill, in case law, or in the Controlled Substances Act seemed to say anything about CBD. So entrepreneurs interpreted this research-oriented pilot program as the de facto legalization of cannabidiol.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration disagreed, but couldn’t stop the tidal wave of CBD production. In 2018,\n<a title href="https://www.kyagr.com/marketing/hemp-overview.html">\nover 60 percent\n</a>\nof the hemp crop in Kentucky was grown for CBD. Then, long after the country was already flooded with CBD products both dubious and legitimate, Mr. McConnell inserted language into the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly making hemp\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process">\nfederally legal\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany of the Californians who plotted at Ms. Miller’s house in 2011 have watched in frustration as the CBD industry flourished, divorced from THC, and fake CBD misled consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn his deathbed in 2014, Mr. Ringo insisted to friends and family that the Stanleys used his seeds to develop their famous strain Charlotte’s Web. Joel Stanley told me the genetics for Charlotte’s Web were a “cross of wild hemp with an industry genetic.” Critics of the Stanley brothers in the cannabis industry have grown annoyed by their prominence and push for patents. Their company has been valued at over half a billion dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller, who still runs a cannabis testing lab, told me that in the years since the 2011 summit, she has become disillusioned as people she’d thought had earnest intentions in spreading CBD turned out to just want to get rich. Mr. Gardner feels the same way.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteep Hill provides cannabis testing services to cultivators, processors, dispensaries, collectives and authorized medical cannabis patients.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nThere has been a slight uptick in clinical research around the compound’s relation to anxiety, schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. In September, the National Institutes of Health\n<a title href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-investigate-minor-cannabinoids-terpenes-potential-pain-relieving-properties">\napproved\n</a>\n$3 million in small grants for studies of cannabidiol and other non-THC cannabis compounds. Nevertheless, the government-enabled ham-handed rush to profiteering has seriously, and unduly, undermined CBD’s medical reputation.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven Dr. Turner, Mr. Reagan’s drug czar, said there is far more evidence for the benefits of Sativex, the half-CBD, half-THC drug, than for unregulated CBD online.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There haven’t been enough clinical trials and there never will be,” said Mr. Clarke, the cannabis seed collector. “There’s no vested financial interest in anyone doing it.” Big Pharma is most invested in medications that they can control, that they alone can patent.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill, some of the states with legal cannabis have implemented robust testing standards, and bona fide CBD can be found at many marijuana dispensaries, both on its own and in a variety of ratios with THC. Ms. Miller’s lab, and other responsible actors, are supposed to ensure products that hit legal pot shop shelves contain exactly what they claim to contain. But without stringent federal oversight, few in the CBD business will voluntarily opt-in to tests of their product labeling’s accuracy.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen I asked Dr. Russo, who oversaw much of GW Pharmaceuticals’ research, how he feels about it all, he sighed. “You do something, and other people run with it, and it turns into something else that you don’t recognize,” he said. “I’m always concerned, but what I like to dwell upon is: What is the real potential here?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Chicago Lewis (\n<a title href="https://twitter.com/msamandalewis">\n@msamandalewis\n</a>\n) is an investigative reporter, focusing on drug policy.

If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes.

We believe that it is critical to move quickly and define such a standard, thereby freeing up researchers to innovate and diversify at the level of higher level algorithms and graph analytics applications. This effort was inspired by the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) of dense Linear Algebra, and hence our working name for this standard is “the GraphBLAS”.\n</p>\n<p>\nA key insight behind this work is that when a graph is represented by a sparse incidence or adjacency matrix, sparse matrix-vector multiplication is a step of breadth first search. By generalizing the pair of scalar operations involved in the linear algebra computations to define a semiring, we can extend the range of these primitives to support a wide range of parallel graph algorithms.\n</p>\n<h1>\n<span>\nMore information\n</span>\n</h1>\n<p>\nA C reference implementation, SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS, can be downloaded from\n<a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur 2013 manifesto for this project can be found\n<a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/PAPERS/GraphPrimitives-HPEC.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe mathematical definition of the GraphBLAS can be found\n<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kepner/GraphBLAS/GraphBLAS-Math-release.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBackground information about graphs in the language of linear algebra can be found in the book:\n<a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/se22/">\nGraph Algorithms in the Language of Linear Algebra\n</a>\n, edited by J.

Poor parts of the Midlands and north of England would get lots of infrastructure investment, helping them to close the productivity gap with London. The country would be “levelled up”.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe idea always seemed a little far-fetched. British governments have been trying to boost productivity outside London for decades, with not much success. And it seems less and less likely that the government will be able to focus on grand new designs as opposed to hasty repair jobs. But something else might happen, to spare Mr Johnson’s blushes. Rather than levelling up, Britain could be about to level down, as London sags.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon was not always the great success it is now. After the second world war the government, which had already pinched the capital with a thick Green Belt, deliberately pushed businesses and citizens out to “new towns” in the Home Counties. Manufacturing declined, as did the docks that had once provided jobs and prosperity. By the 1980s the city’s population had fallen by a quarter from the 8.6m it had hit in 1939. London’s schools and services were famously awful.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the Big Bang deregulated financial services in 1986, the logic of agglomeration reasserted itself and London took off. The creative industries and, in recent years, a thriving tech centre have joined the staples of banking, asset management and business services. Schools, policing and transport have all been transformed. People have flooded in from all continents, making London the world’s most global city.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet some warning signs have been visible for a while. Although London’s population has continued to grow, over the last decade that has been driven by international migration and the birth rate. Between 2008 and 2018, 550,000 more Britons left London than moved to it. People complain of high costs and anxiety. One league table in which London scores poorly is the Office for National Statistics’ rankings of well-being and life satisfaction. Since 2015 migration from the capital has helped reduce the differential between London’s house prices and those in the rest of the country (see chart).\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img src="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200523_BRC642.png">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBut London’s house prices remain double those elsewhere. After housing costs are accounted for Londoners are, on average, worse off than residents of the rest of southern England or Scotland. The chairman of\n<small>\nPWC\n</small>\n, a professional-services firm, has argued that graduates are turning their backs on London. Whereas 60% of graduates working for the big four accounting firms used to be based in the capital, in 2018 60% of new starters were outside.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe London office-cost premium is even higher than the housing-cost one. Prime square footage in the capital costs three times as much as space in other southern cities and seven to nine times as much as elsewhere in Britain. According to a legal recruitment firm, a company can save about £20,000 ($24,500) a year by moving a lawyer out of central London, after office costs and salary are taken into account. “Northshoring”—usually referring, confusingly, to places such as Birmingham that are far from northerly—has become something of a buzzword in the industry.\n<small>\nHSBC\n</small>\nchose to move its British retail banking headquarters to Birmingham in 2017. Amazon, an internet retailer, picked Manchester for its major British corporate site in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the coronavirus crushes property values and office rents, London might become a little less offputting. Perhaps some graduates will be tempted back from Leeds or Manchester. But covid-19 and the extreme social-distancing measures used to combat it pose a new and more profound danger to the capital, for they threaten two factors that have been central to its success: fun and foreigners.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon’s triumph is at least partially based on it being a fun place to live. “People come here not only because you can get paid well but because you can have a good time,” says Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy. The bars and cafes of the East End have been an important driver of what Mr McWillams once dubbed the “flat white economy”, where people with interesting hair bounce ideas off each other while drinking trendy beverages.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt is hard to have a flat white economy when you have to maintain two-metre distancing while queuing for your caffeine. Restaurateurs fear that being forced to operate at a lower capacity will drive many of them out of business. Theatres are facing disaster. As a hedge-fund manager puts it, “London without the culture and the restaurants is just a more expensive Frankfurt with more congestion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCovid-19 might combine with Brexit to cut international migration. Although foreign candidates for London jobs will score better on Britain’s new points-based immigration system than those for jobs elsewhere in the country, because the jobs are better paid, the signal has been sent: Britain is not keen on mass immigration. Universities fear that foreign student numbers could fall by 20-50% in the year ahead. For London, with its more than 100,000 foreign students, that is a problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike all great cities, London could also suffer from changing assumptions about work. Many firms now expect that some people will keep working from home even after the danger of coronavirus has receded—if not every day then several days a week. As firms learn to make do with smaller offices, workers might prize bigger homes outside London where they can have an office. The trade-off between space and commuting time looks different if you only have to go in two or three times a week. But if this happens, it will probably benefit commuter towns in the south-east rather than the northern and Midlands towns that Mr Johnson wanted to help.\n</p>\n<p>\nLisa Taylor of Coherent Cities, a consultancy, remains optimistic. “The next two years are going to be very tough,” she argues.“But a different city could emerge on the other side. One where land use has changed, where we have more co-working and co-living spaces.” She reckons that a greener, less congested London could take its inspiration from cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But those are hardly world-beating metropolises.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon is unlikely to slip back into the dismal state it was in before the mid-1980s. It is likely to remain richer and more productive than the rest of Britain. It will remain Europe’s most powerful magnet for talented immigrants. Still, its pulling power is likely to wane. If that happens, Britain’s economy will probably suffer. But a less centralised country, in which opportunity was more evenly distributed, might be a better place in other ways.\n<span>\n■\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\nEditor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of\n</em>\nThe Economist Today\n<em>\n, our daily\n<a href="https://my.economist.com/user#newsletter">\nnewsletter\n</a>\n.

They sat in a circle at a house in the hills a few hours north of San Francisco — where wine country becomes weed country — to discuss the therapeutic potential of CBD, and how to get people to take it seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeveral studies in rodents and in cell cultures had\n<a title href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462008000300015&lng=en&tlng=en">\nsuggested\n</a>\nthat CBD, a nonintoxicating compound from the cannabis plant more formally known as cannabidiol, could protect the nervous system, modulate blood flow, slow the growth of cancer cells and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We were talking about, ‘What can we do with this?’ ” recalled Samantha Miller, who hosted the event at her split-level house, wedged between redwoods and a creek below. A headstrong biochemist, she had been growing marijuana since the age of 14 and had just quit a six-figure job to start her own cannabis testing lab\n<strong>\n.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSamantha Miller at her home in northern California.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA ragtag crew of activists, doctors, writers and marijuana farmers met to discuss the potential of CBD in 2011 at Samantha Miller’s home.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nAfter two years of tracking down high-CBD pot plants and building momentum, the group began to devise ways to persuade more farmers to grow strains with CBD — which had largely been bred out of American pot since it doesn’t get you high. In addition to convincing marijuana dispensaries to widely carry CBD, they wanted to educate the public about its promising benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the group of ten or so brainstormed, a balloon of vaporized pot was passed in one direction and a bong in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There was a strong sense that this was really going to be something, if when people use these strains they have any kind of experience like the mice did in the laboratories,” said Martin Lee, a writer who at the time had been finishing a book\n<a title href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Smoke_Signals.html?id=8XE-AAAAQBAJ">\nabout the social history of marijuana\n</a>\nfor Simon &amp; Schuster.\n</p>\n<p>\nNear him was Stacey Kerr, a physician with flowing silver hair who served as treasurer of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, as well as Wade Laughter, a soft-spoken man in glasses who had started cultivating pot for his glaucoma in the mid-90s. Mr. Laughter and Lawrence Ringo, an old-school hippie grower, were some of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC — the compound that does get you high. Both pledged to keep their strains available for other growers at cheap prices. (Mr. Ringo said he would sell his seeds for as little as $5.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, there was Fred Gardner, a writer who had recruited almost all of these people to the CBD cause. A Harvard-educated former antiwar activist, now 78, Mr. Gardner had been writing about CBD since the late 1990s for publications like Synapse,\n<a title href="https://synapse.library.ucsf.edu/?a=d&d=ucsf19990701-01.2.4&srpos=2&e=-------en--20--1--txt-fred+gardner+gw-----txIN--">\nthe U.C. San Francisco weekly\n</a>\n. For years, he’d been determined to connect the nascent CBD research he heard about at symposiums abroad with the medical marijuana movement in California. And with this group, finally, it seemed to be coming together.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller spent the months after this meeting leading hundreds of CBD seminars for farmers; Dr. Kerr began informal patient surveys to track how CBD made people feel; and as he finished his book, Mr. Lee often traveled around with Mr. Laughter and Mr. Ringo’s high-CBD plants and seeds, spreading the gospel at pot shops across the West.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was aware that this was a pretty special moment,” Dr. Kerr told me, talking about the night at Ms. Miller’s. “That it was the beginning of something big, and we were there to see it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAt the time of Samantha Miller’s summit in 2011\n</strong>\n, THC was the sole chemical “face” of the plant. Cannabis containing significant amounts of CBD was still rare. Police raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana businesses were still common. And because CBD doesn’t get you high, it was easy to miss; hardly anyone outside of pharmaceutical companies and academia had heard of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the nine years since that night in the woods, one of the group’s biggest goals has clearly been accomplished: People know about CBD.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/opinion/24lewis4/merlin_170651910_ce93e3a5-32dd-4c3c-8a14-3e9a5751f199-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nIt has been estimated that the U.S. CBD industry will be worth $16 billion by 2025.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nJennifer Aniston loves beauty products made with it.

That’s because the federal government’s insistence that cannabis has no legitimate use as a medicine created two enormous problems: the proliferation of fake CBD products and the nonsensical separation of CBD from THC.\n</p>\n<p>\nClinical studies\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16209908">\nhave shown\n</a>\nthat CBD is most effective when paired with at least some THC, even if it is not enough to cause a high. However, the United States considers cannabis with THC to be a Schedule 1 drug — which puts it in the same category as heroin, indicating a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use.

So federal agencies have been\n<a title href="https://hempindustrydaily.com/fda-cbd-regulation-delay-is-costing-profits-and-shelf-space/">\nslow to regulate\n</a>\nthe booming industry — leading to a deluge of tinctures, smoothies and lotions that trusted tests have shown contain no CBD at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the absence of oversight, the push to get more patients access to cannabis medicine — and bona fide CBD — has been co-opted by a push to make as much money as possible off the next big wellness fad. “At a certain point, it had a life of its own,” Ms. Miller told me.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, the CBD industry promises a miracle drug but is often selling a placebo: cannabidiol products with zero cannabidiol inside. As a result, the compound is often caricatured as snake oil, a scam, even as promising research into the full potential of CBD is starting to pick up.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe compound’s reputation is a microcosm of what it means to be in America right now: a thing that some of us consider a hoax and others praise as the solution to everything. But CBD’s rollicking journey from the international underground to cultural ubiquity proves that, as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAs marijuana use increased in the 1960s and ’70s\n</strong>\n, and the Nixon administration criminalized drugs to vilify what\n<a title href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">\none aide described\n</a>\nas “the antiwar left and black people,” the more science-minded side of the government began funding some basic cannabis research. A man named Carlton Turner helped establish the government’s Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi. After that, he became President Ronald Reagan’s drug czar, helping to\n<a title href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-10-26-8603200589-story.html">\nexpand the War on Drugs\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut all the while, Mr. Turner was in touch with a Brazilian scientist named Elisaldo Carlini who had done\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7028792">\nsmall-scale human studies\n</a>\nshowing CBD reduced seizures: “All the early work on CBD was Carlini in Brazil,” Mr. Turner told me this past summer. “We were in communication for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFor decades, Dr. Carlini’s research was not replicated, in part because so few people had access to the compound: Both the pot held at the nation’s sole government-sanctioned marijuana lab at the University of Mississippi and the illegal pot being smoked around the country had only trace CBD content. (Mr. Turner even tested several kinds of cannabis sent by a legendary pot grower, a writer for “High Times” named Mel Frank. To no avail: none of it contained much CBD.)\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nCarlton Turner helped establish the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nThe University of Mississippi\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nIn those years, emissaries of California’s counterculture were often traveling the world looking for unique strains of cannabis. The most influential of these collectors was a man named David Watson. In the early 70s, Mr. Watson sold his possessions and began hitchhiking from Morocco to India, befriending local pot growers along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Watson ultimately settled in Amsterdam to examine his thousands of kinds of cannabis at his own Dutch state-licensed company, HortaPharm BV. He brought in a friend, an American botanist named Robert Connell Clarke to help. When Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke heard about the CBD research Dr. Carlini had done in Brazil, the pair identified and then bred CBD varietals. This led to a discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It attenuates the high,” Mr. Clarke told me over breakfast in Los Angeles. “That came strictly from anecdotal stoner evidence.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA marijuana plant.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nRobert Connell Clarke was an influential collector of unique strains of cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, after multiple sclerosis patients in England became more vocal about how cannabis helped their symptoms, the country allowed a small pharmaceutical company led by a British physician named\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nDr. Geoffrey Guy\n</a>\nto develop plant-derived cannabis medicines; GW Pharmaceuticals\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nlicensed varietals\n</a>\nbred from Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke’s collection of cannabis and got to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Within a couple of years, they figured out a 1:1 combination of a high-THC chemovar and a high-CBD chemovar presented the greatest latitude of effects and prevention of side effects,” said Dr. Ethan Russo, who worked with GW Pharmaceuticals from 1998 to 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke had discovered, having CBD in the mix reduced THC’s more uncomfortable effects: sedation, inebriation, a faster heart rate. And though a few outliers responded well to CBD alone, GW’s data showed that for relieving pain and inflammation, helping with sleep and alleviating seizures and spasms, most patients got the most benefit from an equal mix of CBD and THC — a drug the company called\n<a title href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-feb-01-me-medpot1-story.html">\nSativex\n</a>\n. But the research wasn’t enough. Although the drug has been approved for use in around 30 countries, the F.D.A. has yet to approve Sativex in the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nMr. Gardner, the writer whose CBD advocacy\n</strong>\neventually inspired the 2011 summit\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA copy of O’Shaughnessy’s, the Journal of Cannabis in Clinical Practice, from 2011.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nFred Gardner in his home on March 2, 2020.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nEnter, three years later, one of Oakland’s pioneering pot entrepreneurs, a medical marijuana impresario with pigtail braids named Steve DeAngelo. Mr. DeAngelo, who had been in contact with Mr. Gardner about the urgent need to institute better testing, agreed to help fund a cannabis analysis lab, Steep Hill, which began its operations in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Gardner came by frequently, chatting and checking in to see if Steep Hill’s founders had discovered the elusive compound. And at last, in February 2009 a dual peak on a testing graph appeared, indicating the presence of CBD.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I remember the moment,” said David Lampach, one of the lab’s funders and co-founders. “Seeing the dual peak and realizing it was real, and running it like five times to make sure.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the summer of 2009, the lab had identified five strains with significant CBD and THC. Mr. Gardner was elated, and began referring to his efforts as “Project CBD” alongside other supporters, including Mr. Lee, the writer. “Right away the thought was: ‘What is the government going to say about this? How can they be against something that’s nonintoxicating?’ ” Mr. Lee said.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June of 2010, the host of the 2011 summit, the biochemist Ms. Miller, opened her own lab, Pure Analytics. A few months later, she called Mr. Ringo, the hippie grower, to let him know a pot sample he sent in was a strain with a lot of CBD — as much as 11 percent.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nContainers of a cannabis flower samples at the Steep Hill lab, which began operations in 2008.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA technician macerating cannabis flower samples at Pure Analytics.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n“He’s in the trim room on speaker, and this big whoop goes up,” she said, remembering his staff’s excitement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 2010, a\n<a title href="https://www.projectcbd.org/">\nProject CBD\n</a>\nwebsite was set up where anyone could look through studies organized by disease or condition. Mr. Lee took charge of running it and it began to attract an audience. A few months later, the network of early CBD advocates met up at Ms. Miller’s house in California to coordinate their evangelism. And by the middle of 2011, word of cannabidiol had permeated the population that would become its most potent promotional engine: the chronically ill, people with cancer, with ALS, with serious disorders that weren’t responding to prescription drugs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs stories about CBD’s power spread, demand increased and prices rose. Sick people often relied on the generosity of growers like Mr. Ringo, his son Dakota told me.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nLawrence Ringo in Blocksburg, Calif., about 2010. He was of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKathleen Hart\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n“I’d go up there and see people dying of cancer hanging out with him, and he’d be hooking them up with oil he made in his house,” the younger Mr. Ringo said. Mike Hyde, whose son was suffering from brain cancer, spent months driving around Colorado and the West Coast looking for CBD in late 2011, before connecting with Mr. Ringo at a restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d never met this guy before, and he brought us literally probably $30,000 worth of oil for this CBD that no one could even get,” Mr. Hyde explained. “For free.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCBD’s big launch into the mainstream came when the world saw evidence of what Dr. Carlini had discovered in Brazil, back in the 1970s: the compound’s ability to quell seizures. Unlike a reduction in pain, this was something any politician or camera crew could easily see. It wasn’t a stoner scam.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, in December 2011, an epileptic child used CBD on the Discovery Channel’s “Weed Wars,” a show featuring the co-founder of the Steep Hill lab, Mr. DeAngelo. The following year, the parents of an epileptic boy in San Francisco\n<a title href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/medical-marijuana-epilepsy/">\nbought\n</a>\nCBD from a pot shop. Then, looking for a better quality product, they contacted GW Pharmaceuticals — the British company that had licensed the cannabis collection of those globe-trotting 20th century cannabis collectors, Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke, and which conducted the research in the ’90s that spurred Mr. Gardner’s CBD advocacy. The\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\ncompany developed\n</a>\na 98 percent CBD drug for the boy and others like him.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteve DeAngelo, a pioneering pot entrepreneur.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\n‘Bubba D’ plants in the Clones &amp; Seeds section of Harborside, one of the first dispensary to laboratory test cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nPerhaps the most critical turning point for CBD came in August 2013, when a CNN special hosted by Dr. Sanjay Gupta profiled a 6-year-old girl in Colorado, Charlotte Figi, who used CBD to treat her epilepsy, as well as the brawny brothers who grew her CBD, the Stanleys. Hundreds of families — witnessing the power of CBD enhanced by cable news production values — moved to Colorado to gain access to the Stanleys’ CBD oil, called Charlotte’s Web. The Stanleys told me their wait-list peaked at 15,000 names. And because of public demand, the F.D.A. fast-tracked clinical trials of GW Pharmaceuticals’ 98 percent CBD drug, Epidiolex.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly, everyone wanted CBD, even though no one quite understood it. In the confusion, there was money to be made. Mere weeks after the CNN documentary aired, the spike in CBD interest prompted the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n<a title href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2013/finra-warns-investors-marijuana-stock-scams">\nto issue an investor alert\n</a>\non marijuana stock scams: As the F.D.A. would\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/warning-letters-and-test-results-cannabidiol-related-products">\nlater show\n</a>\n, many online CBD products contained little or no CBD whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIn 2020, CBD is available three ways:\n</strong>\nover the counter; at state-licensed marijuana dispensaries; or if you have certain forms of epilepsy, from GW Pharmaceuticals. Most Americans encounter CBD in the first and most unreliable way — at, say, a bodega in Brooklyn or a health food store in Indiana. A consultant hired to do an investigation by a corporate chain recently told me that the percentage of over-the-counter CBD products that contained the amount on the label was “in the single digits.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs if CBD’s back story couldn’t get any weirder, the path to this glut of phony CBD was paved by, of all people, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnrelated to the brouhaha on the West Coast, tobacco farmers in Kentucky were seeking a new cash crop. In 2011, James Comer won the race for Kentucky state agriculture commissioner by promising to legalize industrial hemp.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That raised a lot of eyebrows, including in McConnell’s office,” Eric Steenstra, a hemp lobbyist, told me. “They saw the winds were shifting.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlong with Representative Jared Polis, now the governor of Colorado, Mr. McConnell included a hemp pilot program in the 2014 farm bill — for “research.” In the legislation, hemp was defined as cannabis containing\n<a title href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/">\nless than 0.3 percent THC\n</a>\n— an arbitrary threshold, not a scientific distinction: Nothing in the Farm Bill, in case law, or in the Controlled Substances Act seemed to say anything about CBD. So entrepreneurs interpreted this research-oriented pilot program as the de facto legalization of cannabidiol.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration disagreed, but couldn’t stop the tidal wave of CBD production. In 2018,\n<a title href="https://www.kyagr.com/marketing/hemp-overview.html">\nover 60 percent\n</a>\nof the hemp crop in Kentucky was grown for CBD. Then, long after the country was already flooded with CBD products both dubious and legitimate, Mr. McConnell inserted language into the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly making hemp\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process">\nfederally legal\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany of the Californians who plotted at Ms. Miller’s house in 2011 have watched in frustration as the CBD industry flourished, divorced from THC, and fake CBD misled consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn his deathbed in 2014, Mr. Ringo insisted to friends and family that the Stanleys used his seeds to develop their famous strain Charlotte’s Web. Joel Stanley told me the genetics for Charlotte’s Web were a “cross of wild hemp with an industry genetic.” Critics of the Stanley brothers in the cannabis industry have grown annoyed by their prominence and push for patents. Their company has been valued at over half a billion dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller, who still runs a cannabis testing lab, told me that in the years since the 2011 summit, she has become disillusioned as people she’d thought had earnest intentions in spreading CBD turned out to just want to get rich. Mr. Gardner feels the same way.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteep Hill provides cannabis testing services to cultivators, processors, dispensaries, collectives and authorized medical cannabis patients.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nThere has been a slight uptick in clinical research around the compound’s relation to anxiety, schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. In September, the National Institutes of Health\n<a title href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-investigate-minor-cannabinoids-terpenes-potential-pain-relieving-properties">\napproved\n</a>\n$3 million in small grants for studies of cannabidiol and other non-THC cannabis compounds. Nevertheless, the government-enabled ham-handed rush to profiteering has seriously, and unduly, undermined CBD’s medical reputation.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven Dr. Turner, Mr. Reagan’s drug czar, said there is far more evidence for the benefits of Sativex, the half-CBD, half-THC drug, than for unregulated CBD online.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There haven’t been enough clinical trials and there never will be,” said Mr. Clarke, the cannabis seed collector. “There’s no vested financial interest in anyone doing it.” Big Pharma is most invested in medications that they can control, that they alone can patent.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill, some of the states with legal cannabis have implemented robust testing standards, and bona fide CBD can be found at many marijuana dispensaries, both on its own and in a variety of ratios with THC. Ms. Miller’s lab, and other responsible actors, are supposed to ensure products that hit legal pot shop shelves contain exactly what they claim to contain. But without stringent federal oversight, few in the CBD business will voluntarily opt-in to tests of their product labeling’s accuracy.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen I asked Dr. Russo, who oversaw much of GW Pharmaceuticals’ research, how he feels about it all, he sighed. “You do something, and other people run with it, and it turns into something else that you don’t recognize,” he said. “I’m always concerned, but what I like to dwell upon is: What is the real potential here?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Chicago Lewis (\n<a title href="https://twitter.com/msamandalewis">\n@msamandalewis\n</a>\n) is an investigative reporter, focusing on drug policy.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I protect myself while flying?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf air travel is unavoidable,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html">\nthere are some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n</a>\nMost important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public.

Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor.

A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public.

Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor.

We believe that it is critical to move quickly and define such a standard, thereby freeing up researchers to innovate and diversify at the level of higher level algorithms and graph analytics applications. This effort was inspired by the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) of dense Linear Algebra, and hence our working name for this standard is “the GraphBLAS”.\n</p>\n<p>\nA key insight behind this work is that when a graph is represented by a sparse incidence or adjacency matrix, sparse matrix-vector multiplication is a step of breadth first search. By generalizing the pair of scalar operations involved in the linear algebra computations to define a semiring, we can extend the range of these primitives to support a wide range of parallel graph algorithms.\n</p>\n<h1>\n<span>\nMore information\n</span>\n</h1>\n<p>\nA C reference implementation, SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS, can be downloaded from\n<a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur 2013 manifesto for this project can be found\n<a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/PAPERS/GraphPrimitives-HPEC.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe mathematical definition of the GraphBLAS can be found\n<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kepner/GraphBLAS/GraphBLAS-Math-release.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBackground information about graphs in the language of linear algebra can be found in the book:\n<a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/se22/">\nGraph Algorithms in the Language of Linear Algebra\n</a>\n, edited by J.

And it seems less and less likely that the government will be able to focus on grand new designs as opposed to hasty repair jobs. But something else might happen, to spare Mr Johnson’s blushes. Rather than levelling up, Britain could be about to level down, as London sags.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon was not always the great success it is now. After the second world war the government, which had already pinched the capital with a thick Green Belt, deliberately pushed businesses and citizens out to “new towns” in the Home Counties. Manufacturing declined, as did the docks that had once provided jobs and prosperity. By the 1980s the city’s population had fallen by a quarter from the 8.6m it had hit in 1939. London’s schools and services were famously awful.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the Big Bang deregulated financial services in 1986, the logic of agglomeration reasserted itself and London took off. The creative industries and, in recent years, a thriving tech centre have joined the staples of banking, asset management and business services. Schools, policing and transport have all been transformed. People have flooded in from all continents, making London the world’s most global city.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet some warning signs have been visible for a while. Although London’s population has continued to grow, over the last decade that has been driven by international migration and the birth rate. Between 2008 and 2018, 550,000 more Britons left London than moved to it. People complain of high costs and anxiety. One league table in which London scores poorly is the Office for National Statistics’ rankings of well-being and life satisfaction. Since 2015 migration from the capital has helped reduce the differential between London’s house prices and those in the rest of the country (see chart).\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img src="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200523_BRC642.png">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBut London’s house prices remain double those elsewhere. After housing costs are accounted for Londoners are, on average, worse off than residents of the rest of southern England or Scotland. The chairman of\n<small>\nPWC\n</small>\n, a professional-services firm, has argued that graduates are turning their backs on London. Whereas 60% of graduates working for the big four accounting firms used to be based in the capital, in 2018 60% of new starters were outside.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe London office-cost premium is even higher than the housing-cost one. Prime square footage in the capital costs three times as much as space in other southern cities and seven to nine times as much as elsewhere in Britain. According to a legal recruitment firm, a company can save about £20,000 ($24,500) a year by moving a lawyer out of central London, after office costs and salary are taken into account. “Northshoring”—usually referring, confusingly, to places such as Birmingham that are far from northerly—has become something of a buzzword in the industry.\n<small>\nHSBC\n</small>\nchose to move its British retail banking headquarters to Birmingham in 2017. Amazon, an internet retailer, picked Manchester for its major British corporate site in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the coronavirus crushes property values and office rents, London might become a little less offputting. Perhaps some graduates will be tempted back from Leeds or Manchester. But covid-19 and the extreme social-distancing measures used to combat it pose a new and more profound danger to the capital, for they threaten two factors that have been central to its success: fun and foreigners.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon’s triumph is at least partially based on it being a fun place to live. “People come here not only because you can get paid well but because you can have a good time,” says Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy. The bars and cafes of the East End have been an important driver of what Mr McWillams once dubbed the “flat white economy”, where people with interesting hair bounce ideas off each other while drinking trendy beverages.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt is hard to have a flat white economy when you have to maintain two-metre distancing while queuing for your caffeine. Restaurateurs fear that being forced to operate at a lower capacity will drive many of them out of business. Theatres are facing disaster. As a hedge-fund manager puts it, “London without the culture and the restaurants is just a more expensive Frankfurt with more congestion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCovid-19 might combine with Brexit to cut international migration. Although foreign candidates for London jobs will score better on Britain’s new points-based immigration system than those for jobs elsewhere in the country, because the jobs are better paid, the signal has been sent: Britain is not keen on mass immigration. Universities fear that foreign student numbers could fall by 20-50% in the year ahead. For London, with its more than 100,000 foreign students, that is a problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike all great cities, London could also suffer from changing assumptions about work. Many firms now expect that some people will keep working from home even after the danger of coronavirus has receded—if not every day then several days a week. As firms learn to make do with smaller offices, workers might prize bigger homes outside London where they can have an office. The trade-off between space and commuting time looks different if you only have to go in two or three times a week. But if this happens, it will probably benefit commuter towns in the south-east rather than the northern and Midlands towns that Mr Johnson wanted to help.\n</p>\n<p>\nLisa Taylor of Coherent Cities, a consultancy, remains optimistic. “The next two years are going to be very tough,” she argues.“But a different city could emerge on the other side. One where land use has changed, where we have more co-working and co-living spaces.” She reckons that a greener, less congested London could take its inspiration from cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But those are hardly world-beating metropolises.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon is unlikely to slip back into the dismal state it was in before the mid-1980s. It is likely to remain richer and more productive than the rest of Britain. It will remain Europe’s most powerful magnet for talented immigrants. Still, its pulling power is likely to wane. If that happens, Britain’s economy will probably suffer. But a less centralised country, in which opportunity was more evenly distributed, might be a better place in other ways.\n<span>\n■\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\nEditor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of\n</em>\nThe Economist Today\n<em>\n, our daily\n<a href="https://my.economist.com/user#newsletter">\nnewsletter\n</a>\n.

They sat in a circle at a house in the hills a few hours north of San Francisco — where wine country becomes weed country — to discuss the therapeutic potential of CBD, and how to get people to take it seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeveral studies in rodents and in cell cultures had\n<a title href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462008000300015&lng=en&tlng=en">\nsuggested\n</a>\nthat CBD, a nonintoxicating compound from the cannabis plant more formally known as cannabidiol, could protect the nervous system, modulate blood flow, slow the growth of cancer cells and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We were talking about, ‘What can we do with this?’ ” recalled Samantha Miller, who hosted the event at her split-level house, wedged between redwoods and a creek below. A headstrong biochemist, she had been growing marijuana since the age of 14 and had just quit a six-figure job to start her own cannabis testing lab\n<strong>\n.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSamantha Miller at her home in northern California.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA ragtag crew of activists, doctors, writers and marijuana farmers met to discuss the potential of CBD in 2011 at Samantha Miller’s home.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nAfter two years of tracking down high-CBD pot plants and building momentum, the group began to devise ways to persuade more farmers to grow strains with CBD — which had largely been bred out of American pot since it doesn’t get you high. In addition to convincing marijuana dispensaries to widely carry CBD, they wanted to educate the public about its promising benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the group of ten or so brainstormed, a balloon of vaporized pot was passed in one direction and a bong in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There was a strong sense that this was really going to be something, if when people use these strains they have any kind of experience like the mice did in the laboratories,” said Martin Lee, a writer who at the time had been finishing a book\n<a title href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Smoke_Signals.html?id=8XE-AAAAQBAJ">\nabout the social history of marijuana\n</a>\nfor Simon &amp; Schuster.\n</p>\n<p>\nNear him was Stacey Kerr, a physician with flowing silver hair who served as treasurer of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, as well as Wade Laughter, a soft-spoken man in glasses who had started cultivating pot for his glaucoma in the mid-90s. Mr. Laughter and Lawrence Ringo, an old-school hippie grower, were some of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC — the compound that does get you high. Both pledged to keep their strains available for other growers at cheap prices. (Mr. Ringo said he would sell his seeds for as little as $5.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, there was Fred Gardner, a writer who had recruited almost all of these people to the CBD cause. A Harvard-educated former antiwar activist, now 78, Mr. Gardner had been writing about CBD since the late 1990s for publications like Synapse,\n<a title href="https://synapse.library.ucsf.edu/?a=d&d=ucsf19990701-01.2.4&srpos=2&e=-------en--20--1--txt-fred+gardner+gw-----txIN--">\nthe U.C. San Francisco weekly\n</a>\n. For years, he’d been determined to connect the nascent CBD research he heard about at symposiums abroad with the medical marijuana movement in California. And with this group, finally, it seemed to be coming together.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller spent the months after this meeting leading hundreds of CBD seminars for farmers; Dr. Kerr began informal patient surveys to track how CBD made people feel; and as he finished his book, Mr. Lee often traveled around with Mr. Laughter and Mr. Ringo’s high-CBD plants and seeds, spreading the gospel at pot shops across the West.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was aware that this was a pretty special moment,” Dr. Kerr told me, talking about the night at Ms. Miller’s. “That it was the beginning of something big, and we were there to see it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAt the time of Samantha Miller’s summit in 2011\n</strong>\n, THC was the sole chemical “face” of the plant. Cannabis containing significant amounts of CBD was still rare. Police raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana businesses were still common. And because CBD doesn’t get you high, it was easy to miss; hardly anyone outside of pharmaceutical companies and academia had heard of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the nine years since that night in the woods, one of the group’s biggest goals has clearly been accomplished: People know about CBD.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/opinion/24lewis4/merlin_170651910_ce93e3a5-32dd-4c3c-8a14-3e9a5751f199-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nIt has been estimated that the U.S. CBD industry will be worth $16 billion by 2025.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nJennifer Aniston loves beauty products made with it.

That’s because the federal government’s insistence that cannabis has no legitimate use as a medicine created two enormous problems: the proliferation of fake CBD products and the nonsensical separation of CBD from THC.\n</p>\n<p>\nClinical studies\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16209908">\nhave shown\n</a>\nthat CBD is most effective when paired with at least some THC, even if it is not enough to cause a high. However, the United States considers cannabis with THC to be a Schedule 1 drug — which puts it in the same category as heroin, indicating a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This makes further research very difficult to do, and causes sick people in many states to be treated as criminals.\n</p>\n<p>\nCannabis that is high in CBD but extremely low in THC was made legal at the end of 2018. But finding an easy, affordable test that is able to distinguish cannabis with THC from cannabis without THC has been prohibitively difficult\n<a title href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/02/21/hot-hemp-pits-states-against-feds">\nfor farmers\n</a>\nand\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/cbd-thc-cannabis-cannabidiol.html">\ncrime labs\n</a>\nalike. So federal agencies have been\n<a title href="https://hempindustrydaily.com/fda-cbd-regulation-delay-is-costing-profits-and-shelf-space/">\nslow to regulate\n</a>\nthe booming industry — leading to a deluge of tinctures, smoothies and lotions that trusted tests have shown contain no CBD at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the absence of oversight, the push to get more patients access to cannabis medicine — and bona fide CBD — has been co-opted by a push to make as much money as possible off the next big wellness fad. “At a certain point, it had a life of its own,” Ms. Miller told me.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, the CBD industry promises a miracle drug but is often selling a placebo: cannabidiol products with zero cannabidiol inside. As a result, the compound is often caricatured as snake oil, a scam, even as promising research into the full potential of CBD is starting to pick up.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe compound’s reputation is a microcosm of what it means to be in America right now: a thing that some of us consider a hoax and others praise as the solution to everything. But CBD’s rollicking journey from the international underground to cultural ubiquity proves that, as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAs marijuana use increased in the 1960s and ’70s\n</strong>\n, and the Nixon administration criminalized drugs to vilify what\n<a title href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">\none aide described\n</a>\nas “the antiwar left and black people,” the more science-minded side of the government began funding some basic cannabis research. A man named Carlton Turner helped establish the government’s Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi. After that, he became President Ronald Reagan’s drug czar, helping to\n<a title href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-10-26-8603200589-story.html">\nexpand the War on Drugs\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut all the while, Mr. Turner was in touch with a Brazilian scientist named Elisaldo Carlini who had done\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7028792">\nsmall-scale human studies\n</a>\nshowing CBD reduced seizures: “All the early work on CBD was Carlini in Brazil,” Mr. Turner told me this past summer. “We were in communication for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFor decades, Dr. Carlini’s research was not replicated, in part because so few people had access to the compound: Both the pot held at the nation’s sole government-sanctioned marijuana lab at the University of Mississippi and the illegal pot being smoked around the country had only trace CBD content. (Mr. Turner even tested several kinds of cannabis sent by a legendary pot grower, a writer for “High Times” named Mel Frank. To no avail: none of it contained much CBD.)\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nCarlton Turner helped establish the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nThe University of Mississippi\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nIn those years, emissaries of California’s counterculture were often traveling the world looking for unique strains of cannabis. The most influential of these collectors was a man named David Watson. In the early 70s, Mr. Watson sold his possessions and began hitchhiking from Morocco to India, befriending local pot growers along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Watson ultimately settled in Amsterdam to examine his thousands of kinds of cannabis at his own Dutch state-licensed company, HortaPharm BV. He brought in a friend, an American botanist named Robert Connell Clarke to help. When Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke heard about the CBD research Dr. Carlini had done in Brazil, the pair identified and then bred CBD varietals. This led to a discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It attenuates the high,” Mr. Clarke told me over breakfast in Los Angeles. “That came strictly from anecdotal stoner evidence.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA marijuana plant.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nRobert Connell Clarke was an influential collector of unique strains of cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, after multiple sclerosis patients in England became more vocal about how cannabis helped their symptoms, the country allowed a small pharmaceutical company led by a British physician named\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nDr. Geoffrey Guy\n</a>\nto develop plant-derived cannabis medicines; GW Pharmaceuticals\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nlicensed varietals\n</a>\nbred from Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke’s collection of cannabis and got to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Within a couple of years, they figured out a 1:1 combination of a high-THC chemovar and a high-CBD chemovar presented the greatest latitude of effects and prevention of side effects,” said Dr. Ethan Russo, who worked with GW Pharmaceuticals from 1998 to 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke had discovered, having CBD in the mix reduced THC’s more uncomfortable effects: sedation, inebriation, a faster heart rate. And though a few outliers responded well to CBD alone, GW’s data showed that for relieving pain and inflammation, helping with sleep and alleviating seizures and spasms, most patients got the most benefit from an equal mix of CBD and THC — a drug the company called\n<a title href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-feb-01-me-medpot1-story.html">\nSativex\n</a>\n. But the research wasn’t enough. Although the drug has been approved for use in around 30 countries, the F.D.A. has yet to approve Sativex in the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nMr. Gardner, the writer whose CBD advocacy\n</strong>\neventually inspired the 2011 summit\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA copy of O’Shaughnessy’s, the Journal of Cannabis in Clinical Practice, from 2011.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nFred Gardner in his home on March 2, 2020.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nEnter, three years later, one of Oakland’s pioneering pot entrepreneurs, a medical marijuana impresario with pigtail braids named Steve DeAngelo. Mr. DeAngelo, who had been in contact with Mr. Gardner about the urgent need to institute better testing, agreed to help fund a cannabis analysis lab, Steep Hill, which began its operations in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Gardner came by frequently, chatting and checking in to see if Steep Hill’s founders had discovered the elusive compound. And at last, in February 2009 a dual peak on a testing graph appeared, indicating the presence of CBD.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I remember the moment,” said David Lampach, one of the lab’s funders and co-founders. “Seeing the dual peak and realizing it was real, and running it like five times to make sure.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the summer of 2009, the lab had identified five strains with significant CBD and THC. Mr. Gardner was elated, and began referring to his efforts as “Project CBD” alongside other supporters, including Mr. Lee, the writer. “Right away the thought was: ‘What is the government going to say about this? How can they be against something that’s nonintoxicating?’ ” Mr. Lee said.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June of 2010, the host of the 2011 summit, the biochemist Ms. Miller, opened her own lab, Pure Analytics. A few months later, she called Mr. Ringo, the hippie grower, to let him know a pot sample he sent in was a strain with a lot of CBD — as much as 11 percent.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nContainers of a cannabis flower samples at the Steep Hill lab, which began operations in 2008.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA technician macerating cannabis flower samples at Pure Analytics.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n“He’s in the trim room on speaker, and this big whoop goes up,” she said, remembering his staff’s excitement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 2010, a\n<a title href="https://www.projectcbd.org/">\nProject CBD\n</a>\nwebsite was set up where anyone could look through studies organized by disease or condition. Mr. Lee took charge of running it and it began to attract an audience. A few months later, the network of early CBD advocates met up at Ms. Miller’s house in California to coordinate their evangelism. And by the middle of 2011, word of cannabidiol had permeated the population that would become its most potent promotional engine: the chronically ill, people with cancer, with ALS, with serious disorders that weren’t responding to prescription drugs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs stories about CBD’s power spread, demand increased and prices rose. Sick people often relied on the generosity of growers like Mr. Ringo, his son Dakota told me.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nLawrence Ringo in Blocksburg, Calif., about 2010. He was of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKathleen Hart\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n“I’d go up there and see people dying of cancer hanging out with him, and he’d be hooking them up with oil he made in his house,” the younger Mr. Ringo said. Mike Hyde, whose son was suffering from brain cancer, spent months driving around Colorado and the West Coast looking for CBD in late 2011, before connecting with Mr. Ringo at a restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d never met this guy before, and he brought us literally probably $30,000 worth of oil for this CBD that no one could even get,” Mr. Hyde explained. “For free.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCBD’s big launch into the mainstream came when the world saw evidence of what Dr. Carlini had discovered in Brazil, back in the 1970s: the compound’s ability to quell seizures. Unlike a reduction in pain, this was something any politician or camera crew could easily see. It wasn’t a stoner scam.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, in December 2011, an epileptic child used CBD on the Discovery Channel’s “Weed Wars,” a show featuring the co-founder of the Steep Hill lab, Mr. DeAngelo. The following year, the parents of an epileptic boy in San Francisco\n<a title href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/medical-marijuana-epilepsy/">\nbought\n</a>\nCBD from a pot shop. Then, looking for a better quality product, they contacted GW Pharmaceuticals — the British company that had licensed the cannabis collection of those globe-trotting 20th century cannabis collectors, Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke, and which conducted the research in the ’90s that spurred Mr. Gardner’s CBD advocacy. The\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\ncompany developed\n</a>\na 98 percent CBD drug for the boy and others like him.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteve DeAngelo, a pioneering pot entrepreneur.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\n‘Bubba D’ plants in the Clones &amp; Seeds section of Harborside, one of the first dispensary to laboratory test cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nPerhaps the most critical turning point for CBD came in August 2013, when a CNN special hosted by Dr. Sanjay Gupta profiled a 6-year-old girl in Colorado, Charlotte Figi, who used CBD to treat her epilepsy, as well as the brawny brothers who grew her CBD, the Stanleys. Hundreds of families — witnessing the power of CBD enhanced by cable news production values — moved to Colorado to gain access to the Stanleys’ CBD oil, called Charlotte’s Web. The Stanleys told me their wait-list peaked at 15,000 names. And because of public demand, the F.D.A. fast-tracked clinical trials of GW Pharmaceuticals’ 98 percent CBD drug, Epidiolex.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly, everyone wanted CBD, even though no one quite understood it. In the confusion, there was money to be made. Mere weeks after the CNN documentary aired, the spike in CBD interest prompted the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n<a title href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2013/finra-warns-investors-marijuana-stock-scams">\nto issue an investor alert\n</a>\non marijuana stock scams: As the F.D.A. would\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/warning-letters-and-test-results-cannabidiol-related-products">\nlater show\n</a>\n, many online CBD products contained little or no CBD whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIn 2020, CBD is available three ways:\n</strong>\nover the counter; at state-licensed marijuana dispensaries; or if you have certain forms of epilepsy, from GW Pharmaceuticals. Most Americans encounter CBD in the first and most unreliable way — at, say, a bodega in Brooklyn or a health food store in Indiana. A consultant hired to do an investigation by a corporate chain recently told me that the percentage of over-the-counter CBD products that contained the amount on the label was “in the single digits.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs if CBD’s back story couldn’t get any weirder, the path to this glut of phony CBD was paved by, of all people, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnrelated to the brouhaha on the West Coast, tobacco farmers in Kentucky were seeking a new cash crop. In 2011, James Comer won the race for Kentucky state agriculture commissioner by promising to legalize industrial hemp.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That raised a lot of eyebrows, including in McConnell’s office,” Eric Steenstra, a hemp lobbyist, told me. “They saw the winds were shifting.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlong with Representative Jared Polis, now the governor of Colorado, Mr. McConnell included a hemp pilot program in the 2014 farm bill — for “research.” In the legislation, hemp was defined as cannabis containing\n<a title href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/">\nless than 0.3 percent THC\n</a>\n— an arbitrary threshold, not a scientific distinction: Nothing in the Farm Bill, in case law, or in the Controlled Substances Act seemed to say anything about CBD. So entrepreneurs interpreted this research-oriented pilot program as the de facto legalization of cannabidiol.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration disagreed, but couldn’t stop the tidal wave of CBD production. In 2018,\n<a title href="https://www.kyagr.com/marketing/hemp-overview.html">\nover 60 percent\n</a>\nof the hemp crop in Kentucky was grown for CBD. Then, long after the country was already flooded with CBD products both dubious and legitimate, Mr. McConnell inserted language into the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly making hemp\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process">\nfederally legal\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany of the Californians who plotted at Ms. Miller’s house in 2011 have watched in frustration as the CBD industry flourished, divorced from THC, and fake CBD misled consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn his deathbed in 2014, Mr. Ringo insisted to friends and family that the Stanleys used his seeds to develop their famous strain Charlotte’s Web. Joel Stanley told me the genetics for Charlotte’s Web were a “cross of wild hemp with an industry genetic.” Critics of the Stanley brothers in the cannabis industry have grown annoyed by their prominence and push for patents. Their company has been valued at over half a billion dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller, who still runs a cannabis testing lab, told me that in the years since the 2011 summit, she has become disillusioned as people she’d thought had earnest intentions in spreading CBD turned out to just want to get rich. Mr. Gardner feels the same way.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteep Hill provides cannabis testing services to cultivators, processors, dispensaries, collectives and authorized medical cannabis patients.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nThere has been a slight uptick in clinical research around the compound’s relation to anxiety, schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. In September, the National Institutes of Health\n<a title href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-investigate-minor-cannabinoids-terpenes-potential-pain-relieving-properties">\napproved\n</a>\n$3 million in small grants for studies of cannabidiol and other non-THC cannabis compounds. Nevertheless, the government-enabled ham-handed rush to profiteering has seriously, and unduly, undermined CBD’s medical reputation.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven Dr. Turner, Mr. Reagan’s drug czar, said there is far more evidence for the benefits of Sativex, the half-CBD, half-THC drug, than for unregulated CBD online.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There haven’t been enough clinical trials and there never will be,” said Mr. Clarke, the cannabis seed collector. “There’s no vested financial interest in anyone doing it.” Big Pharma is most invested in medications that they can control, that they alone can patent.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill, some of the states with legal cannabis have implemented robust testing standards, and bona fide CBD can be found at many marijuana dispensaries, both on its own and in a variety of ratios with THC. Ms. Miller’s lab, and other responsible actors, are supposed to ensure products that hit legal pot shop shelves contain exactly what they claim to contain. But without stringent federal oversight, few in the CBD business will voluntarily opt-in to tests of their product labeling’s accuracy.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen I asked Dr. Russo, who oversaw much of GW Pharmaceuticals’ research, how he feels about it all, he sighed. “You do something, and other people run with it, and it turns into something else that you don’t recognize,” he said. “I’m always concerned, but what I like to dwell upon is: What is the real potential here?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Chicago Lewis (\n<a title href="https://twitter.com/msamandalewis">\n@msamandalewis\n</a>\n) is an investigative reporter, focusing on drug policy.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I protect myself while flying?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf air travel is unavoidable,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html">\nthere are some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n</a>\nMost important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html">\nnew concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms\n</a>\n. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor.

Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I help?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=7779">\nCharity Navigator\n</a>\n, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I protect myself while flying?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf air travel is unavoidable,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html">\nthere are some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n</a>\nMost important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html">\nnew concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms\n</a>\n. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I get tested?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nthe C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears.\n</a>\nThey will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I help?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=7779">\nCharity Navigator\n</a>\n, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak.

We believe that it is critical to move quickly and define such a standard, thereby freeing up researchers to innovate and diversify at the level of higher level algorithms and graph analytics applications. This effort was inspired by the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) of dense Linear Algebra, and hence our working name for this standard is “the GraphBLAS”.\n</p>\n<p>\nA key insight behind this work is that when a graph is represented by a sparse incidence or adjacency matrix, sparse matrix-vector multiplication is a step of breadth first search.

Poor parts of the Midlands and north of England would get lots of infrastructure investment, helping them to close the productivity gap with London. The country would be “levelled up”.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe idea always seemed a little far-fetched. British governments have been trying to boost productivity outside London for decades, with not much success. And it seems less and less likely that the government will be able to focus on grand new designs as opposed to hasty repair jobs. But something else might happen, to spare Mr Johnson’s blushes. Rather than levelling up, Britain could be about to level down, as London sags.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon was not always the great success it is now. After the second world war the government, which had already pinched the capital with a thick Green Belt, deliberately pushed businesses and citizens out to “new towns” in the Home Counties. Manufacturing declined, as did the docks that had once provided jobs and prosperity. By the 1980s the city’s population had fallen by a quarter from the 8.6m it had hit in 1939. London’s schools and services were famously awful.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the Big Bang deregulated financial services in 1986, the logic of agglomeration reasserted itself and London took off. The creative industries and, in recent years, a thriving tech centre have joined the staples of banking, asset management and business services. Schools, policing and transport have all been transformed. People have flooded in from all continents, making London the world’s most global city.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet some warning signs have been visible for a while. Although London’s population has continued to grow, over the last decade that has been driven by international migration and the birth rate. Between 2008 and 2018, 550,000 more Britons left London than moved to it. People complain of high costs and anxiety. One league table in which London scores poorly is the Office for National Statistics’ rankings of well-being and life satisfaction. Since 2015 migration from the capital has helped reduce the differential between London’s house prices and those in the rest of the country (see chart).\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img src="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200523_BRC642.png">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBut London’s house prices remain double those elsewhere. After housing costs are accounted for Londoners are, on average, worse off than residents of the rest of southern England or Scotland. The chairman of\n<small>\nPWC\n</small>\n, a professional-services firm, has argued that graduates are turning their backs on London. Whereas 60% of graduates working for the big four accounting firms used to be based in the capital, in 2018 60% of new starters were outside.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe London office-cost premium is even higher than the housing-cost one. Prime square footage in the capital costs three times as much as space in other southern cities and seven to nine times as much as elsewhere in Britain. According to a legal recruitment firm, a company can save about £20,000 ($24,500) a year by moving a lawyer out of central London, after office costs and salary are taken into account. “Northshoring”—usually referring, confusingly, to places such as Birmingham that are far from northerly—has become something of a buzzword in the industry.\n<small>\nHSBC\n</small>\nchose to move its British retail banking headquarters to Birmingham in 2017. Amazon, an internet retailer, picked Manchester for its major British corporate site in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the coronavirus crushes property values and office rents, London might become a little less offputting. Perhaps some graduates will be tempted back from Leeds or Manchester. But covid-19 and the extreme social-distancing measures used to combat it pose a new and more profound danger to the capital, for they threaten two factors that have been central to its success: fun and foreigners.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon’s triumph is at least partially based on it being a fun place to live. “People come here not only because you can get paid well but because you can have a good time,” says Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy. The bars and cafes of the East End have been an important driver of what Mr McWillams once dubbed the “flat white economy”, where people with interesting hair bounce ideas off each other while drinking trendy beverages.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt is hard to have a flat white economy when you have to maintain two-metre distancing while queuing for your caffeine. Restaurateurs fear that being forced to operate at a lower capacity will drive many of them out of business. Theatres are facing disaster. As a hedge-fund manager puts it, “London without the culture and the restaurants is just a more expensive Frankfurt with more congestion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCovid-19 might combine with Brexit to cut international migration. Although foreign candidates for London jobs will score better on Britain’s new points-based immigration system than those for jobs elsewhere in the country, because the jobs are better paid, the signal has been sent: Britain is not keen on mass immigration. Universities fear that foreign student numbers could fall by 20-50% in the year ahead. For London, with its more than 100,000 foreign students, that is a problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike all great cities, London could also suffer from changing assumptions about work. Many firms now expect that some people will keep working from home even after the danger of coronavirus has receded—if not every day then several days a week. As firms learn to make do with smaller offices, workers might prize bigger homes outside London where they can have an office. The trade-off between space and commuting time looks different if you only have to go in two or three times a week. But if this happens, it will probably benefit commuter towns in the south-east rather than the northern and Midlands towns that Mr Johnson wanted to help.\n</p>\n<p>\nLisa Taylor of Coherent Cities, a consultancy, remains optimistic. “The next two years are going to be very tough,” she argues.“But a different city could emerge on the other side. One where land use has changed, where we have more co-working and co-living spaces.” She reckons that a greener, less congested London could take its inspiration from cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But those are hardly world-beating metropolises.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon is unlikely to slip back into the dismal state it was in before the mid-1980s. It is likely to remain richer and more productive than the rest of Britain. It will remain Europe’s most powerful magnet for talented immigrants. Still, its pulling power is likely to wane. If that happens, Britain’s economy will probably suffer. But a less centralised country, in which opportunity was more evenly distributed, might be a better place in other ways.\n<span>\n■\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\nEditor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of\n</em>\nThe Economist Today\n<em>\n, our daily\n<a href="https://my.economist.com/user#newsletter">\nnewsletter\n</a>\n.

They sat in a circle at a house in the hills a few hours north of San Francisco — where wine country becomes weed country — to discuss the therapeutic potential of CBD, and how to get people to take it seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeveral studies in rodents and in cell cultures had\n<a title href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462008000300015&lng=en&tlng=en">\nsuggested\n</a>\nthat CBD, a nonintoxicating compound from the cannabis plant more formally known as cannabidiol, could protect the nervous system, modulate blood flow, slow the growth of cancer cells and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We were talking about, ‘What can we do with this?’ ” recalled Samantha Miller, who hosted the event at her split-level house, wedged between redwoods and a creek below. A headstrong biochemist, she had been growing marijuana since the age of 14 and had just quit a six-figure job to start her own cannabis testing lab\n<strong>\n.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSamantha Miller at her home in northern California.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA ragtag crew of activists, doctors, writers and marijuana farmers met to discuss the potential of CBD in 2011 at Samantha Miller’s home.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nAfter two years of tracking down high-CBD pot plants and building momentum, the group began to devise ways to persuade more farmers to grow strains with CBD — which had largely been bred out of American pot since it doesn’t get you high. In addition to convincing marijuana dispensaries to widely carry CBD, they wanted to educate the public about its promising benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the group of ten or so brainstormed, a balloon of vaporized pot was passed in one direction and a bong in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There was a strong sense that this was really going to be something, if when people use these strains they have any kind of experience like the mice did in the laboratories,” said Martin Lee, a writer who at the time had been finishing a book\n<a title href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Smoke_Signals.html?id=8XE-AAAAQBAJ">\nabout the social history of marijuana\n</a>\nfor Simon &amp; Schuster.\n</p>\n<p>\nNear him was Stacey Kerr, a physician with flowing silver hair who served as treasurer of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, as well as Wade Laughter, a soft-spoken man in glasses who had started cultivating pot for his glaucoma in the mid-90s. Mr. Laughter and Lawrence Ringo, an old-school hippie grower, were some of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC — the compound that does get you high. Both pledged to keep their strains available for other growers at cheap prices. (Mr. Ringo said he would sell his seeds for as little as $5.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, there was Fred Gardner, a writer who had recruited almost all of these people to the CBD cause. A Harvard-educated former antiwar activist, now 78, Mr. Gardner had been writing about CBD since the late 1990s for publications like Synapse,\n<a title href="https://synapse.library.ucsf.edu/?a=d&d=ucsf19990701-01.2.4&srpos=2&e=-------en--20--1--txt-fred+gardner+gw-----txIN--">\nthe U.C. San Francisco weekly\n</a>\n. For years, he’d been determined to connect the nascent CBD research he heard about at symposiums abroad with the medical marijuana movement in California. And with this group, finally, it seemed to be coming together.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller spent the months after this meeting leading hundreds of CBD seminars for farmers; Dr. Kerr began informal patient surveys to track how CBD made people feel; and as he finished his book, Mr. Lee often traveled around with Mr. Laughter and Mr. Ringo’s high-CBD plants and seeds, spreading the gospel at pot shops across the West.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was aware that this was a pretty special moment,” Dr. Kerr told me, talking about the night at Ms. Miller’s. “That it was the beginning of something big, and we were there to see it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAt the time of Samantha Miller’s summit in 2011\n</strong>\n, THC was the sole chemical “face” of the plant. Cannabis containing significant amounts of CBD was still rare. Police raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana businesses were still common. And because CBD doesn’t get you high, it was easy to miss; hardly anyone outside of pharmaceutical companies and academia had heard of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the nine years since that night in the woods, one of the group’s biggest goals has clearly been accomplished: People know about CBD.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/opinion/24lewis4/merlin_170651910_ce93e3a5-32dd-4c3c-8a14-3e9a5751f199-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nIt has been estimated that the U.S. CBD industry will be worth $16 billion by 2025.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nJennifer Aniston loves beauty products made with it.

That’s because the federal government’s insistence that cannabis has no legitimate use as a medicine created two enormous problems: the proliferation of fake CBD products and the nonsensical separation of CBD from THC.\n</p>\n<p>\nClinical studies\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16209908">\nhave shown\n</a>\nthat CBD is most effective when paired with at least some THC, even if it is not enough to cause a high. However, the United States considers cannabis with THC to be a Schedule 1 drug — which puts it in the same category as heroin, indicating a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This makes further research very difficult to do, and causes sick people in many states to be treated as criminals.\n</p>\n<p>\nCannabis that is high in CBD but extremely low in THC was made legal at the end of 2018. But finding an easy, affordable test that is able to distinguish cannabis with THC from cannabis without THC has been prohibitively difficult\n<a title href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/02/21/hot-hemp-pits-states-against-feds">\nfor farmers\n</a>\nand\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/cbd-thc-cannabis-cannabidiol.html">\ncrime labs\n</a>\nalike. So federal agencies have been\n<a title href="https://hempindustrydaily.com/fda-cbd-regulation-delay-is-costing-profits-and-shelf-space/">\nslow to regulate\n</a>\nthe booming industry — leading to a deluge of tinctures, smoothies and lotions that trusted tests have shown contain no CBD at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the absence of oversight, the push to get more patients access to cannabis medicine — and bona fide CBD — has been co-opted by a push to make as much money as possible off the next big wellness fad. “At a certain point, it had a life of its own,” Ms. Miller told me.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, the CBD industry promises a miracle drug but is often selling a placebo: cannabidiol products with zero cannabidiol inside. As a result, the compound is often caricatured as snake oil, a scam, even as promising research into the full potential of CBD is starting to pick up.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe compound’s reputation is a microcosm of what it means to be in America right now: a thing that some of us consider a hoax and others praise as the solution to everything. But CBD’s rollicking journey from the international underground to cultural ubiquity proves that, as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAs marijuana use increased in the 1960s and ’70s\n</strong>\n, and the Nixon administration criminalized drugs to vilify what\n<a title href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">\none aide described\n</a>\nas “the antiwar left and black people,” the more science-minded side of the government began funding some basic cannabis research. A man named Carlton Turner helped establish the government’s Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi. After that, he became President Ronald Reagan’s drug czar, helping to\n<a title href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-10-26-8603200589-story.html">\nexpand the War on Drugs\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut all the while, Mr. Turner was in touch with a Brazilian scientist named Elisaldo Carlini who had done\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7028792">\nsmall-scale human studies\n</a>\nshowing CBD reduced seizures: “All the early work on CBD was Carlini in Brazil,” Mr. Turner told me this past summer. “We were in communication for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFor decades, Dr. Carlini’s research was not replicated, in part because so few people had access to the compound: Both the pot held at the nation’s sole government-sanctioned marijuana lab at the University of Mississippi and the illegal pot being smoked around the country had only trace CBD content. (Mr. Turner even tested several kinds of cannabis sent by a legendary pot grower, a writer for “High Times” named Mel Frank. To no avail: none of it contained much CBD.)\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nCarlton Turner helped establish the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nThe University of Mississippi\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nIn those years, emissaries of California’s counterculture were often traveling the world looking for unique strains of cannabis. The most influential of these collectors was a man named David Watson. In the early 70s, Mr. Watson sold his possessions and began hitchhiking from Morocco to India, befriending local pot growers along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Watson ultimately settled in Amsterdam to examine his thousands of kinds of cannabis at his own Dutch state-licensed company, HortaPharm BV. He brought in a friend, an American botanist named Robert Connell Clarke to help. When Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke heard about the CBD research Dr. Carlini had done in Brazil, the pair identified and then bred CBD varietals. This led to a discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It attenuates the high,” Mr. Clarke told me over breakfast in Los Angeles. “That came strictly from anecdotal stoner evidence.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA marijuana plant.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nRobert Connell Clarke was an influential collector of unique strains of cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, after multiple sclerosis patients in England became more vocal about how cannabis helped their symptoms, the country allowed a small pharmaceutical company led by a British physician named\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nDr. Geoffrey Guy\n</a>\nto develop plant-derived cannabis medicines; GW Pharmaceuticals\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nlicensed varietals\n</a>\nbred from Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke’s collection of cannabis and got to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Within a couple of years, they figured out a 1:1 combination of a high-THC chemovar and a high-CBD chemovar presented the greatest latitude of effects and prevention of side effects,” said Dr. Ethan Russo, who worked with GW Pharmaceuticals from 1998 to 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke had discovered, having CBD in the mix reduced THC’s more uncomfortable effects: sedation, inebriation, a faster heart rate. And though a few outliers responded well to CBD alone, GW’s data showed that for relieving pain and inflammation, helping with sleep and alleviating seizures and spasms, most patients got the most benefit from an equal mix of CBD and THC — a drug the company called\n<a title href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-feb-01-me-medpot1-story.html">\nSativex\n</a>\n. But the research wasn’t enough.

Mr. DeAngelo, who had been in contact with Mr. Gardner about the urgent need to institute better testing, agreed to help fund a cannabis analysis lab, Steep Hill, which began its operations in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Gardner came by frequently, chatting and checking in to see if Steep Hill’s founders had discovered the elusive compound. And at last, in February 2009 a dual peak on a testing graph appeared, indicating the presence of CBD.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I remember the moment,” said David Lampach, one of the lab’s funders and co-founders. “Seeing the dual peak and realizing it was real, and running it like five times to make sure.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the summer of 2009, the lab had identified five strains with significant CBD and THC. Mr. Gardner was elated, and began referring to his efforts as “Project CBD” alongside other supporters, including Mr. Lee, the writer. “Right away the thought was: ‘What is the government going to say about this? How can they be against something that’s nonintoxicating?’ ” Mr. Lee said.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June of 2010, the host of the 2011 summit, the biochemist Ms. Miller, opened her own lab, Pure Analytics. A few months later, she called Mr. Ringo, the hippie grower, to let him know a pot sample he sent in was a strain with a lot of CBD — as much as 11 percent.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nContainers of a cannabis flower samples at the Steep Hill lab, which began operations in 2008.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA technician macerating cannabis flower samples at Pure Analytics.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n“He’s in the trim room on speaker, and this big whoop goes up,” she said, remembering his staff’s excitement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 2010, a\n<a title href="https://www.projectcbd.org/">\nProject CBD\n</a>\nwebsite was set up where anyone could look through studies organized by disease or condition. Mr. Lee took charge of running it and it began to attract an audience. A few months later, the network of early CBD advocates met up at Ms. Miller’s house in California to coordinate their evangelism. And by the middle of 2011, word of cannabidiol had permeated the population that would become its most potent promotional engine: the chronically ill, people with cancer, with ALS, with serious disorders that weren’t responding to prescription drugs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs stories about CBD’s power spread, demand increased and prices rose. Sick people often relied on the generosity of growers like Mr. Ringo, his son Dakota told me.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nLawrence Ringo in Blocksburg, Calif., about 2010. He was of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKathleen Hart\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n“I’d go up there and see people dying of cancer hanging out with him, and he’d be hooking them up with oil he made in his house,” the younger Mr. Ringo said. Mike Hyde, whose son was suffering from brain cancer, spent months driving around Colorado and the West Coast looking for CBD in late 2011, before connecting with Mr. Ringo at a restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d never met this guy before, and he brought us literally probably $30,000 worth of oil for this CBD that no one could even get,” Mr. Hyde explained. “For free.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCBD’s big launch into the mainstream came when the world saw evidence of what Dr. Carlini had discovered in Brazil, back in the 1970s: the compound’s ability to quell seizures. Unlike a reduction in pain, this was something any politician or camera crew could easily see. It wasn’t a stoner scam.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, in December 2011, an epileptic child used CBD on the Discovery Channel’s “Weed Wars,” a show featuring the co-founder of the Steep Hill lab, Mr. DeAngelo. The following year, the parents of an epileptic boy in San Francisco\n<a title href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/medical-marijuana-epilepsy/">\nbought\n</a>\nCBD from a pot shop. Then, looking for a better quality product, they contacted GW Pharmaceuticals — the British company that had licensed the cannabis collection of those globe-trotting 20th century cannabis collectors, Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke, and which conducted the research in the ’90s that spurred Mr. Gardner’s CBD advocacy. The\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\ncompany developed\n</a>\na 98 percent CBD drug for the boy and others like him.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteve DeAngelo, a pioneering pot entrepreneur.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\n‘Bubba D’ plants in the Clones &amp; Seeds section of Harborside, one of the first dispensary to laboratory test cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nPerhaps the most critical turning point for CBD came in August 2013, when a CNN special hosted by Dr. Sanjay Gupta profiled a 6-year-old girl in Colorado, Charlotte Figi, who used CBD to treat her epilepsy, as well as the brawny brothers who grew her CBD, the Stanleys. Hundreds of families — witnessing the power of CBD enhanced by cable news production values — moved to Colorado to gain access to the Stanleys’ CBD oil, called Charlotte’s Web. The Stanleys told me their wait-list peaked at 15,000 names. And because of public demand, the F.D.A. fast-tracked clinical trials of GW Pharmaceuticals’ 98 percent CBD drug, Epidiolex.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly, everyone wanted CBD, even though no one quite understood it. In the confusion, there was money to be made. Mere weeks after the CNN documentary aired, the spike in CBD interest prompted the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n<a title href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2013/finra-warns-investors-marijuana-stock-scams">\nto issue an investor alert\n</a>\non marijuana stock scams: As the F.D.A. would\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/warning-letters-and-test-results-cannabidiol-related-products">\nlater show\n</a>\n, many online CBD products contained little or no CBD whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIn 2020, CBD is available three ways:\n</strong>\nover the counter; at state-licensed marijuana dispensaries; or if you have certain forms of epilepsy, from GW Pharmaceuticals. Most Americans encounter CBD in the first and most unreliable way — at, say, a bodega in Brooklyn or a health food store in Indiana. A consultant hired to do an investigation by a corporate chain recently told me that the percentage of over-the-counter CBD products that contained the amount on the label was “in the single digits.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs if CBD’s back story couldn’t get any weirder, the path to this glut of phony CBD was paved by, of all people, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnrelated to the brouhaha on the West Coast, tobacco farmers in Kentucky were seeking a new cash crop. In 2011, James Comer won the race for Kentucky state agriculture commissioner by promising to legalize industrial hemp.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That raised a lot of eyebrows, including in McConnell’s office,” Eric Steenstra, a hemp lobbyist, told me. “They saw the winds were shifting.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlong with Representative Jared Polis, now the governor of Colorado, Mr. McConnell included a hemp pilot program in the 2014 farm bill — for “research.” In the legislation, hemp was defined as cannabis containing\n<a title href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/">\nless than 0.3 percent THC\n</a>\n— an arbitrary threshold, not a scientific distinction: Nothing in the Farm Bill, in case law, or in the Controlled Substances Act seemed to say anything about CBD. So entrepreneurs interpreted this research-oriented pilot program as the de facto legalization of cannabidiol.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration disagreed, but couldn’t stop the tidal wave of CBD production. In 2018,\n<a title href="https://www.kyagr.com/marketing/hemp-overview.html">\nover 60 percent\n</a>\nof the hemp crop in Kentucky was grown for CBD. Then, long after the country was already flooded with CBD products both dubious and legitimate, Mr. McConnell inserted language into the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly making hemp\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process">\nfederally legal\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany of the Californians who plotted at Ms. Miller’s house in 2011 have watched in frustration as the CBD industry flourished, divorced from THC, and fake CBD misled consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn his deathbed in 2014, Mr. Ringo insisted to friends and family that the Stanleys used his seeds to develop their famous strain Charlotte’s Web. Joel Stanley told me the genetics for Charlotte’s Web were a “cross of wild hemp with an industry genetic.” Critics of the Stanley brothers in the cannabis industry have grown annoyed by their prominence and push for patents. Their company has been valued at over half a billion dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller, who still runs a cannabis testing lab, told me that in the years since the 2011 summit, she has become disillusioned as people she’d thought had earnest intentions in spreading CBD turned out to just want to get rich. Mr. Gardner feels the same way.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteep Hill provides cannabis testing services to cultivators, processors, dispensaries, collectives and authorized medical cannabis patients.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nThere has been a slight uptick in clinical research around the compound’s relation to anxiety, schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. In September, the National Institutes of Health\n<a title href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-investigate-minor-cannabinoids-terpenes-potential-pain-relieving-properties">\napproved\n</a>\n$3 million in small grants for studies of cannabidiol and other non-THC cannabis compounds. Nevertheless, the government-enabled ham-handed rush to profiteering has seriously, and unduly, undermined CBD’s medical reputation.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven Dr. Turner, Mr. Reagan’s drug czar, said there is far more evidence for the benefits of Sativex, the half-CBD, half-THC drug, than for unregulated CBD online.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There haven’t been enough clinical trials and there never will be,” said Mr. Clarke, the cannabis seed collector. “There’s no vested financial interest in anyone doing it.” Big Pharma is most invested in medications that they can control, that they alone can patent.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill, some of the states with legal cannabis have implemented robust testing standards, and bona fide CBD can be found at many marijuana dispensaries, both on its own and in a variety of ratios with THC. Ms. Miller’s lab, and other responsible actors, are supposed to ensure products that hit legal pot shop shelves contain exactly what they claim to contain. But without stringent federal oversight, few in the CBD business will voluntarily opt-in to tests of their product labeling’s accuracy.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen I asked Dr. Russo, who oversaw much of GW Pharmaceuticals’ research, how he feels about it all, he sighed. “You do something, and other people run with it, and it turns into something else that you don’t recognize,” he said. “I’m always concerned, but what I like to dwell upon is: What is the real potential here?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Chicago Lewis (\n<a title href="https://twitter.com/msamandalewis">\n@msamandalewis\n</a>\n) is an investigative reporter, focusing on drug policy.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners.

If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people.

We believe that it is critical to move quickly and define such a standard, thereby freeing up researchers to innovate and diversify at the level of higher level algorithms and graph analytics applications. This effort was inspired by the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) of dense Linear Algebra, and hence our working name for this standard is “the GraphBLAS”.\n</p>\n<p>\nA key insight behind this work is that when a graph is represented by a sparse incidence or adjacency matrix, sparse matrix-vector multiplication is a step of breadth first search. By generalizing the pair of scalar operations involved in the linear algebra computations to define a semiring, we can extend the range of these primitives to support a wide range of parallel graph algorithms.\n</p>\n<h1>\n<span>\nMore information\n</span>\n</h1>\n<p>\nA C reference implementation, SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS, can be downloaded from\n<a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur 2013 manifesto for this project can be found\n<a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/PAPERS/GraphPrimitives-HPEC.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe mathematical definition of the GraphBLAS can be found\n<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kepner/GraphBLAS/GraphBLAS-Math-release.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBackground information about graphs in the language of linear algebra can be found in the book:\n<a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/se22/">\nGraph Algorithms in the Language of Linear Algebra\n</a>\n, edited by J.

Poor parts of the Midlands and north of England would get lots of infrastructure investment, helping them to close the productivity gap with London. The country would be “levelled up”.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe idea always seemed a little far-fetched. British governments have been trying to boost productivity outside London for decades, with not much success. And it seems less and less likely that the government will be able to focus on grand new designs as opposed to hasty repair jobs. But something else might happen, to spare Mr Johnson’s blushes. Rather than levelling up, Britain could be about to level down, as London sags.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon was not always the great success it is now. After the second world war the government, which had already pinched the capital with a thick Green Belt, deliberately pushed businesses and citizens out to “new towns” in the Home Counties. Manufacturing declined, as did the docks that had once provided jobs and prosperity. By the 1980s the city’s population had fallen by a quarter from the 8.6m it had hit in 1939. London’s schools and services were famously awful.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the Big Bang deregulated financial services in 1986, the logic of agglomeration reasserted itself and London took off. The creative industries and, in recent years, a thriving tech centre have joined the staples of banking, asset management and business services. Schools, policing and transport have all been transformed. People have flooded in from all continents, making London the world’s most global city.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet some warning signs have been visible for a while. Although London’s population has continued to grow, over the last decade that has been driven by international migration and the birth rate. Between 2008 and 2018, 550,000 more Britons left London than moved to it. People complain of high costs and anxiety. One league table in which London scores poorly is the Office for National Statistics’ rankings of well-being and life satisfaction. Since 2015 migration from the capital has helped reduce the differential between London’s house prices and those in the rest of the country (see chart).\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img src="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200523_BRC642.png">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBut London’s house prices remain double those elsewhere. After housing costs are accounted for Londoners are, on average, worse off than residents of the rest of southern England or Scotland. The chairman of\n<small>\nPWC\n</small>\n, a professional-services firm, has argued that graduates are turning their backs on London. Whereas 60% of graduates working for the big four accounting firms used to be based in the capital, in 2018 60% of new starters were outside.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe London office-cost premium is even higher than the housing-cost one. Prime square footage in the capital costs three times as much as space in other southern cities and seven to nine times as much as elsewhere in Britain. According to a legal recruitment firm, a company can save about £20,000 ($24,500) a year by moving a lawyer out of central London, after office costs and salary are taken into account. “Northshoring”—usually referring, confusingly, to places such as Birmingham that are far from northerly—has become something of a buzzword in the industry.\n<small>\nHSBC\n</small>\nchose to move its British retail banking headquarters to Birmingham in 2017. Amazon, an internet retailer, picked Manchester for its major British corporate site in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the coronavirus crushes property values and office rents, London might become a little less offputting. Perhaps some graduates will be tempted back from Leeds or Manchester. But covid-19 and the extreme social-distancing measures used to combat it pose a new and more profound danger to the capital, for they threaten two factors that have been central to its success: fun and foreigners.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon’s triumph is at least partially based on it being a fun place to live. “People come here not only because you can get paid well but because you can have a good time,” says Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy. The bars and cafes of the East End have been an important driver of what Mr McWillams once dubbed the “flat white economy”, where people with interesting hair bounce ideas off each other while drinking trendy beverages.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt is hard to have a flat white economy when you have to maintain two-metre distancing while queuing for your caffeine. Restaurateurs fear that being forced to operate at a lower capacity will drive many of them out of business. Theatres are facing disaster. As a hedge-fund manager puts it, “London without the culture and the restaurants is just a more expensive Frankfurt with more congestion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCovid-19 might combine with Brexit to cut international migration. Although foreign candidates for London jobs will score better on Britain’s new points-based immigration system than those for jobs elsewhere in the country, because the jobs are better paid, the signal has been sent: Britain is not keen on mass immigration. Universities fear that foreign student numbers could fall by 20-50% in the year ahead. For London, with its more than 100,000 foreign students, that is a problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike all great cities, London could also suffer from changing assumptions about work. Many firms now expect that some people will keep working from home even after the danger of coronavirus has receded—if not every day then several days a week. As firms learn to make do with smaller offices, workers might prize bigger homes outside London where they can have an office. The trade-off between space and commuting time looks different if you only have to go in two or three times a week. But if this happens, it will probably benefit commuter towns in the south-east rather than the northern and Midlands towns that Mr Johnson wanted to help.\n</p>\n<p>\nLisa Taylor of Coherent Cities, a consultancy, remains optimistic. “The next two years are going to be very tough,” she argues.“But a different city could emerge on the other side. One where land use has changed, where we have more co-working and co-living spaces.” She reckons that a greener, less congested London could take its inspiration from cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But those are hardly world-beating metropolises.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon is unlikely to slip back into the dismal state it was in before the mid-1980s. It is likely to remain richer and more productive than the rest of Britain. It will remain Europe’s most powerful magnet for talented immigrants. Still, its pulling power is likely to wane. If that happens, Britain’s economy will probably suffer.

They sat in a circle at a house in the hills a few hours north of San Francisco — where wine country becomes weed country — to discuss the therapeutic potential of CBD, and how to get people to take it seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeveral studies in rodents and in cell cultures had\n<a title href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462008000300015&lng=en&tlng=en">\nsuggested\n</a>\nthat CBD, a nonintoxicating compound from the cannabis plant more formally known as cannabidiol, could protect the nervous system, modulate blood flow, slow the growth of cancer cells and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We were talking about, ‘What can we do with this?’ ” recalled Samantha Miller, who hosted the event at her split-level house, wedged between redwoods and a creek below. A headstrong biochemist, she had been growing marijuana since the age of 14 and had just quit a six-figure job to start her own cannabis testing lab\n<strong>\n.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSamantha Miller at her home in northern California.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA ragtag crew of activists, doctors, writers and marijuana farmers met to discuss the potential of CBD in 2011 at Samantha Miller’s home.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nAfter two years of tracking down high-CBD pot plants and building momentum, the group began to devise ways to persuade more farmers to grow strains with CBD — which had largely been bred out of American pot since it doesn’t get you high. In addition to convincing marijuana dispensaries to widely carry CBD, they wanted to educate the public about its promising benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the group of ten or so brainstormed, a balloon of vaporized pot was passed in one direction and a bong in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There was a strong sense that this was really going to be something, if when people use these strains they have any kind of experience like the mice did in the laboratories,” said Martin Lee, a writer who at the time had been finishing a book\n<a title href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Smoke_Signals.html?id=8XE-AAAAQBAJ">\nabout the social history of marijuana\n</a>\nfor Simon &amp; Schuster.\n</p>\n<p>\nNear him was Stacey Kerr, a physician with flowing silver hair who served as treasurer of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, as well as Wade Laughter, a soft-spoken man in glasses who had started cultivating pot for his glaucoma in the mid-90s. Mr. Laughter and Lawrence Ringo, an old-school hippie grower, were some of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC — the compound that does get you high. Both pledged to keep their strains available for other growers at cheap prices. (Mr. Ringo said he would sell his seeds for as little as $5.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, there was Fred Gardner, a writer who had recruited almost all of these people to the CBD cause. A Harvard-educated former antiwar activist, now 78, Mr. Gardner had been writing about CBD since the late 1990s for publications like Synapse,\n<a title href="https://synapse.library.ucsf.edu/?a=d&d=ucsf19990701-01.2.4&srpos=2&e=-------en--20--1--txt-fred+gardner+gw-----txIN--">\nthe U.C. San Francisco weekly\n</a>\n. For years, he’d been determined to connect the nascent CBD research he heard about at symposiums abroad with the medical marijuana movement in California. And with this group, finally, it seemed to be coming together.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller spent the months after this meeting leading hundreds of CBD seminars for farmers; Dr. Kerr began informal patient surveys to track how CBD made people feel; and as he finished his book, Mr. Lee often traveled around with Mr. Laughter and Mr. Ringo’s high-CBD plants and seeds, spreading the gospel at pot shops across the West.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was aware that this was a pretty special moment,” Dr. Kerr told me, talking about the night at Ms. Miller’s. “That it was the beginning of something big, and we were there to see it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAt the time of Samantha Miller’s summit in 2011\n</strong>\n, THC was the sole chemical “face” of the plant. Cannabis containing significant amounts of CBD was still rare. Police raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana businesses were still common. And because CBD doesn’t get you high, it was easy to miss; hardly anyone outside of pharmaceutical companies and academia had heard of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the nine years since that night in the woods, one of the group’s biggest goals has clearly been accomplished: People know about CBD.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/opinion/24lewis4/merlin_170651910_ce93e3a5-32dd-4c3c-8a14-3e9a5751f199-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nIt has been estimated that the U.S. CBD industry will be worth $16 billion by 2025.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nJennifer Aniston loves beauty products made with it.

And e-commerce sales of CBD\n<a title href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/cbd-e-commerce-sales-are-booming-with-the-world-battling-covid-19-2020-04-06-71975826?mod=mw_quote_news">\nhave grown\n</a>\nthis year amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the CBD landscape of 2020 looks nothing like what the activists and scientists intended. That’s because the federal government’s insistence that cannabis has no legitimate use as a medicine created two enormous problems: the proliferation of fake CBD products and the nonsensical separation of CBD from THC.\n</p>\n<p>\nClinical studies\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16209908">\nhave shown\n</a>\nthat CBD is most effective when paired with at least some THC, even if it is not enough to cause a high. However, the United States considers cannabis with THC to be a Schedule 1 drug — which puts it in the same category as heroin, indicating a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This makes further research very difficult to do, and causes sick people in many states to be treated as criminals.\n</p>\n<p>\nCannabis that is high in CBD but extremely low in THC was made legal at the end of 2018. But finding an easy, affordable test that is able to distinguish cannabis with THC from cannabis without THC has been prohibitively difficult\n<a title href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/02/21/hot-hemp-pits-states-against-feds">\nfor farmers\n</a>\nand\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/cbd-thc-cannabis-cannabidiol.html">\ncrime labs\n</a>\nalike. So federal agencies have been\n<a title href="https://hempindustrydaily.com/fda-cbd-regulation-delay-is-costing-profits-and-shelf-space/">\nslow to regulate\n</a>\nthe booming industry — leading to a deluge of tinctures, smoothies and lotions that trusted tests have shown contain no CBD at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the absence of oversight, the push to get more patients access to cannabis medicine — and bona fide CBD — has been co-opted by a push to make as much money as possible off the next big wellness fad. “At a certain point, it had a life of its own,” Ms. Miller told me.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, the CBD industry promises a miracle drug but is often selling a placebo: cannabidiol products with zero cannabidiol inside. As a result, the compound is often caricatured as snake oil, a scam, even as promising research into the full potential of CBD is starting to pick up.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe compound’s reputation is a microcosm of what it means to be in America right now: a thing that some of us consider a hoax and others praise as the solution to everything. But CBD’s rollicking journey from the international underground to cultural ubiquity proves that, as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nAs marijuana use increased in the 1960s and ’70s\n</strong>\n, and the Nixon administration criminalized drugs to vilify what\n<a title href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">\none aide described\n</a>\nas “the antiwar left and black people,” the more science-minded side of the government began funding some basic cannabis research. A man named Carlton Turner helped establish the government’s Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi. After that, he became President Ronald Reagan’s drug czar, helping to\n<a title href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-10-26-8603200589-story.html">\nexpand the War on Drugs\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut all the while, Mr. Turner was in touch with a Brazilian scientist named Elisaldo Carlini who had done\n<a title href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7028792">\nsmall-scale human studies\n</a>\nshowing CBD reduced seizures: “All the early work on CBD was Carlini in Brazil,” Mr. Turner told me this past summer. “We were in communication for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFor decades, Dr. Carlini’s research was not replicated, in part because so few people had access to the compound: Both the pot held at the nation’s sole government-sanctioned marijuana lab at the University of Mississippi and the illegal pot being smoked around the country had only trace CBD content. (Mr. Turner even tested several kinds of cannabis sent by a legendary pot grower, a writer for “High Times” named Mel Frank. To no avail: none of it contained much CBD.)\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nCarlton Turner helped establish the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nThe University of Mississippi\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nIn those years, emissaries of California’s counterculture were often traveling the world looking for unique strains of cannabis. The most influential of these collectors was a man named David Watson. In the early 70s, Mr. Watson sold his possessions and began hitchhiking from Morocco to India, befriending local pot growers along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Watson ultimately settled in Amsterdam to examine his thousands of kinds of cannabis at his own Dutch state-licensed company, HortaPharm BV. He brought in a friend, an American botanist named Robert Connell Clarke to help. When Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke heard about the CBD research Dr. Carlini had done in Brazil, the pair identified and then bred CBD varietals. This led to a discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It attenuates the high,” Mr. Clarke told me over breakfast in Los Angeles. “That came strictly from anecdotal stoner evidence.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA marijuana plant.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nRobert Connell Clarke was an influential collector of unique strains of cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, after multiple sclerosis patients in England became more vocal about how cannabis helped their symptoms, the country allowed a small pharmaceutical company led by a British physician named\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nDr. Geoffrey Guy\n</a>\nto develop plant-derived cannabis medicines; GW Pharmaceuticals\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\nlicensed varietals\n</a>\nbred from Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke’s collection of cannabis and got to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Within a couple of years, they figured out a 1:1 combination of a high-THC chemovar and a high-CBD chemovar presented the greatest latitude of effects and prevention of side effects,” said Dr. Ethan Russo, who worked with GW Pharmaceuticals from 1998 to 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke had discovered, having CBD in the mix reduced THC’s more uncomfortable effects: sedation, inebriation, a faster heart rate. And though a few outliers responded well to CBD alone, GW’s data showed that for relieving pain and inflammation, helping with sleep and alleviating seizures and spasms, most patients got the most benefit from an equal mix of CBD and THC — a drug the company called\n<a title href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-feb-01-me-medpot1-story.html">\nSativex\n</a>\n. But the research wasn’t enough. Although the drug has been approved for use in around 30 countries, the F.D.A. has yet to approve Sativex in the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nMr. Gardner, the writer whose CBD advocacy\n</strong>\neventually inspired the 2011 summit\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA copy of O’Shaughnessy’s, the Journal of Cannabis in Clinical Practice, from 2011.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nFred Gardner in his home on March 2, 2020.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nEnter, three years later, one of Oakland’s pioneering pot entrepreneurs, a medical marijuana impresario with pigtail braids named Steve DeAngelo. Mr. DeAngelo, who had been in contact with Mr. Gardner about the urgent need to institute better testing, agreed to help fund a cannabis analysis lab, Steep Hill, which began its operations in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Gardner came by frequently, chatting and checking in to see if Steep Hill’s founders had discovered the elusive compound. And at last, in February 2009 a dual peak on a testing graph appeared, indicating the presence of CBD.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I remember the moment,” said David Lampach, one of the lab’s funders and co-founders. “Seeing the dual peak and realizing it was real, and running it like five times to make sure.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the summer of 2009, the lab had identified five strains with significant CBD and THC. Mr. Gardner was elated, and began referring to his efforts as “Project CBD” alongside other supporters, including Mr. Lee, the writer. “Right away the thought was: ‘What is the government going to say about this? How can they be against something that’s nonintoxicating?’ ” Mr. Lee said.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June of 2010, the host of the 2011 summit, the biochemist Ms. Miller, opened her own lab, Pure Analytics. A few months later, she called Mr. Ringo, the hippie grower, to let him know a pot sample he sent in was a strain with a lot of CBD — as much as 11 percent.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nContainers of a cannabis flower samples at the Steep Hill lab, which began operations in 2008.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nA technician macerating cannabis flower samples at Pure Analytics.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n“He’s in the trim room on speaker, and this big whoop goes up,” she said, remembering his staff’s excitement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 2010, a\n<a title href="https://www.projectcbd.org/">\nProject CBD\n</a>\nwebsite was set up where anyone could look through studies organized by disease or condition. Mr. Lee took charge of running it and it began to attract an audience. A few months later, the network of early CBD advocates met up at Ms. Miller’s house in California to coordinate their evangelism. And by the middle of 2011, word of cannabidiol had permeated the population that would become its most potent promotional engine: the chronically ill, people with cancer, with ALS, with serious disorders that weren’t responding to prescription drugs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs stories about CBD’s power spread, demand increased and prices rose. Sick people often relied on the generosity of growers like Mr. Ringo, his son Dakota told me.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nLawrence Ringo in Blocksburg, Calif., about 2010. He was of the first Americans to intentionally cultivate plants higher in CBD than in THC.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKathleen Hart\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n“I’d go up there and see people dying of cancer hanging out with him, and he’d be hooking them up with oil he made in his house,” the younger Mr. Ringo said. Mike Hyde, whose son was suffering from brain cancer, spent months driving around Colorado and the West Coast looking for CBD in late 2011, before connecting with Mr. Ringo at a restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d never met this guy before, and he brought us literally probably $30,000 worth of oil for this CBD that no one could even get,” Mr. Hyde explained. “For free.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCBD’s big launch into the mainstream came when the world saw evidence of what Dr. Carlini had discovered in Brazil, back in the 1970s: the compound’s ability to quell seizures. Unlike a reduction in pain, this was something any politician or camera crew could easily see. It wasn’t a stoner scam.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, in December 2011, an epileptic child used CBD on the Discovery Channel’s “Weed Wars,” a show featuring the co-founder of the Steep Hill lab, Mr. DeAngelo. The following year, the parents of an epileptic boy in San Francisco\n<a title href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/medical-marijuana-epilepsy/">\nbought\n</a>\nCBD from a pot shop. Then, looking for a better quality product, they contacted GW Pharmaceuticals — the British company that had licensed the cannabis collection of those globe-trotting 20th century cannabis collectors, Mr. Watson and Mr. Clarke, and which conducted the research in the ’90s that spurred Mr. Gardner’s CBD advocacy. The\n<a title href="https://touchneurology.com/the-untold-story-of-the-cannabidiol-cbd-revolution/">\ncompany developed\n</a>\na 98 percent CBD drug for the boy and others like him.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteve DeAngelo, a pioneering pot entrepreneur.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\n‘Bubba D’ plants in the Clones &amp; Seeds section of Harborside, one of the first dispensary to laboratory test cannabis.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\nPerhaps the most critical turning point for CBD came in August 2013, when a CNN special hosted by Dr. Sanjay Gupta profiled a 6-year-old girl in Colorado, Charlotte Figi, who used CBD to treat her epilepsy, as well as the brawny brothers who grew her CBD, the Stanleys. Hundreds of families — witnessing the power of CBD enhanced by cable news production values — moved to Colorado to gain access to the Stanleys’ CBD oil, called Charlotte’s Web. The Stanleys told me their wait-list peaked at 15,000 names. And because of public demand, the F.D.A. fast-tracked clinical trials of GW Pharmaceuticals’ 98 percent CBD drug, Epidiolex.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly, everyone wanted CBD, even though no one quite understood it. In the confusion, there was money to be made. Mere weeks after the CNN documentary aired, the spike in CBD interest prompted the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n<a title href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2013/finra-warns-investors-marijuana-stock-scams">\nto issue an investor alert\n</a>\non marijuana stock scams: As the F.D.A. would\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/warning-letters-and-test-results-cannabidiol-related-products">\nlater show\n</a>\n, many online CBD products contained little or no CBD whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIn 2020, CBD is available three ways:\n</strong>\nover the counter; at state-licensed marijuana dispensaries; or if you have certain forms of epilepsy, from GW Pharmaceuticals. Most Americans encounter CBD in the first and most unreliable way — at, say, a bodega in Brooklyn or a health food store in Indiana. A consultant hired to do an investigation by a corporate chain recently told me that the percentage of over-the-counter CBD products that contained the amount on the label was “in the single digits.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs if CBD’s back story couldn’t get any weirder, the path to this glut of phony CBD was paved by, of all people, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnrelated to the brouhaha on the West Coast, tobacco farmers in Kentucky were seeking a new cash crop. In 2011, James Comer won the race for Kentucky state agriculture commissioner by promising to legalize industrial hemp.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That raised a lot of eyebrows, including in McConnell’s office,” Eric Steenstra, a hemp lobbyist, told me. “They saw the winds were shifting.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlong with Representative Jared Polis, now the governor of Colorado, Mr. McConnell included a hemp pilot program in the 2014 farm bill — for “research.” In the legislation, hemp was defined as cannabis containing\n<a title href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/">\nless than 0.3 percent THC\n</a>\n— an arbitrary threshold, not a scientific distinction: Nothing in the Farm Bill, in case law, or in the Controlled Substances Act seemed to say anything about CBD. So entrepreneurs interpreted this research-oriented pilot program as the de facto legalization of cannabidiol.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration disagreed, but couldn’t stop the tidal wave of CBD production. In 2018,\n<a title href="https://www.kyagr.com/marketing/hemp-overview.html">\nover 60 percent\n</a>\nof the hemp crop in Kentucky was grown for CBD. Then, long after the country was already flooded with CBD products both dubious and legitimate, Mr. McConnell inserted language into the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly making hemp\n<a title href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process">\nfederally legal\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany of the Californians who plotted at Ms. Miller’s house in 2011 have watched in frustration as the CBD industry flourished, divorced from THC, and fake CBD misled consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn his deathbed in 2014, Mr. Ringo insisted to friends and family that the Stanleys used his seeds to develop their famous strain Charlotte’s Web. Joel Stanley told me the genetics for Charlotte’s Web were a “cross of wild hemp with an industry genetic.” Critics of the Stanley brothers in the cannabis industry have grown annoyed by their prominence and push for patents. Their company has been valued at over half a billion dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\nMs. Miller, who still runs a cannabis testing lab, told me that in the years since the 2011 summit, she has become disillusioned as people she’d thought had earnest intentions in spreading CBD turned out to just want to get rich. Mr. Gardner feels the same way.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nSteep Hill provides cannabis testing services to cultivators, processors, dispensaries, collectives and authorized medical cannabis patients.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nKelsey McClellan for The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nThere has been a slight uptick in clinical research around the compound’s relation to anxiety, schizophrenia and opioid use disorder. In September, the National Institutes of Health\n<a title href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-investigate-minor-cannabinoids-terpenes-potential-pain-relieving-properties">\napproved\n</a>\n$3 million in small grants for studies of cannabidiol and other non-THC cannabis compounds. Nevertheless, the government-enabled ham-handed rush to profiteering has seriously, and unduly, undermined CBD’s medical reputation.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven Dr. Turner, Mr. Reagan’s drug czar, said there is far more evidence for the benefits of Sativex, the half-CBD, half-THC drug, than for unregulated CBD online.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There haven’t been enough clinical trials and there never will be,” said Mr. Clarke, the cannabis seed collector. “There’s no vested financial interest in anyone doing it.” Big Pharma is most invested in medications that they can control, that they alone can patent.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill, some of the states with legal cannabis have implemented robust testing standards, and bona fide CBD can be found at many marijuana dispensaries, both on its own and in a variety of ratios with THC. Ms. Miller’s lab, and other responsible actors, are supposed to ensure products that hit legal pot shop shelves contain exactly what they claim to contain. But without stringent federal oversight, few in the CBD business will voluntarily opt-in to tests of their product labeling’s accuracy.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen I asked Dr. Russo, who oversaw much of GW Pharmaceuticals’ research, how he feels about it all, he sighed. “You do something, and other people run with it, and it turns into something else that you don’t recognize,” he said. “I’m always concerned, but what I like to dwell upon is: What is the real potential here?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Chicago Lewis (\n<a title href="https://twitter.com/msamandalewis">\n@msamandalewis\n</a>\n) is an investigative reporter, focusing on drug policy.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I protect myself while flying?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf air travel is unavoidable,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html">\nthere are some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n</a>\nMost important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public.

Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor.

A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public.

Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor.

We believe that it is critical to move quickly and define such a standard, thereby freeing up researchers to innovate and diversify at the level of higher level algorithms and graph analytics applications. This effort was inspired by the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) of dense Linear Algebra, and hence our working name for this standard is “the GraphBLAS”.\n</p>\n<p>\nA key insight behind this work is that when a graph is represented by a sparse incidence or adjacency matrix, sparse matrix-vector multiplication is a step of breadth first search. By generalizing the pair of scalar operations involved in the linear algebra computations to define a semiring, we can extend the range of these primitives to support a wide range of parallel graph algorithms.\n</p>\n<h1>\n<span>\nMore information\n</span>\n</h1>\n<p>\nA C reference implementation, SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS, can be downloaded from\n<a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur 2013 manifesto for this project can be found\n<a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/PAPERS/GraphPrimitives-HPEC.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe mathematical definition of the GraphBLAS can be found\n<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kepner/GraphBLAS/GraphBLAS-Math-release.pdf">\nhere\n</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>\nBackground information about graphs in the language of linear algebra can be found in the book:\n<a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/se22/">\nGraph Algorithms in the Language of Linear Algebra\n</a>\n, edited by J.

And it seems less and less likely that the government will be able to focus on grand new designs as opposed to hasty repair jobs. But something else might happen, to spare Mr Johnson’s blushes. Rather than levelling up, Britain could be about to level down, as London sags.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon was not always the great success it is now. After the second world war the government, which had already pinched the capital with a thick Green Belt, deliberately pushed businesses and citizens out to “new towns” in the Home Counties. Manufacturing declined, as did the docks that had once provided jobs and prosperity. By the 1980s the city’s population had fallen by a quarter from the 8.6m it had hit in 1939. London’s schools and services were famously awful.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the Big Bang deregulated financial services in 1986, the logic of agglomeration reasserted itself and London took off. The creative industries and, in recent years, a thriving tech centre have joined the staples of banking, asset management and business services. Schools, policing and transport have all been transformed. People have flooded in from all continents, making London the world’s most global city.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet some warning signs have been visible for a while. Although London’s population has continued to grow, over the last decade that has been driven by international migration and the birth rate. Between 2008 and 2018, 550,000 more Britons left London than moved to it. People complain of high costs and anxiety. One league table in which London scores poorly is the Office for National Statistics’ rankings of well-being and life satisfaction. Since 2015 migration from the capital has helped reduce the differential between London’s house prices and those in the rest of the country (see chart).\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img src="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200523_BRC642.png">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBut London’s house prices remain double those elsewhere. After housing costs are accounted for Londoners are, on average, worse off than residents of the rest of southern England or Scotland. The chairman of\n<small>\nPWC\n</small>\n, a professional-services firm, has argued that graduates are turning their backs on London. Whereas 60% of graduates working for the big four accounting firms used to be based in the capital, in 2018 60% of new starters were outside.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe London office-cost premium is even higher than the housing-cost one. Prime square footage in the capital costs three times as much as space in other southern cities and seven to nine times as much as elsewhere in Britain. According to a legal recruitment firm, a company can save about £20,000 ($24,500) a year by moving a lawyer out of central London, after office costs and salary are taken into account. “Northshoring”—usually referring, confusingly, to places such as Birmingham that are far from northerly—has become something of a buzzword in the industry.\n<small>\nHSBC\n</small>\nchose to move its British retail banking headquarters to Birmingham in 2017. Amazon, an internet retailer, picked Manchester for its major British corporate site in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the coronavirus crushes property values and office rents, London might become a little less offputting. Perhaps some graduates will be tempted back from Leeds or Manchester. But covid-19 and the extreme social-distancing measures used to combat it pose a new and more profound danger to the capital, for they threaten two factors that have been central to its success: fun and foreigners.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon’s triumph is at least partially based on it being a fun place to live. “People come here not only because you can get paid well but because you can have a good time,” says Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy. The bars and cafes of the East End have been an important driver of what Mr McWillams once dubbed the “flat white economy”, where people with interesting hair bounce ideas off each other while drinking trendy beverages.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt is hard to have a flat white economy when you have to maintain two-metre distancing while queuing for your caffeine. Restaurateurs fear that being forced to operate at a lower capacity will drive many of them out of business. Theatres are facing disaster. As a hedge-fund manager puts it, “London without the culture and the restaurants is just a more expensive Frankfurt with more congestion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCovid-19 might combine with Brexit to cut international migration. Although foreign candidates for London jobs will score better on Britain’s new points-based immigration system than those for jobs elsewhere in the country, because the jobs are better paid, the signal has been sent: Britain is not keen on mass immigration. Universities fear that foreign student numbers could fall by 20-50% in the year ahead. For London, with its more than 100,000 foreign students, that is a problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike all great cities, London could also suffer from changing assumptions about work. Many firms now expect that some people will keep working from home even after the danger of coronavirus has receded—if not every day then several days a week. As firms learn to make do with smaller offices, workers might prize bigger homes outside London where they can have an office. The trade-off between space and commuting time looks different if you only have to go in two or three times a week. But if this happens, it will probably benefit commuter towns in the south-east rather than the northern and Midlands towns that Mr Johnson wanted to help.\n</p>\n<p>\nLisa Taylor of Coherent Cities, a consultancy, remains optimistic. “The next two years are going to be very tough,” she argues.“But a different city could emerge on the other side. One where land use has changed, where we have more co-working and co-living spaces.” She reckons that a greener, less congested London could take its inspiration from cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But those are hardly world-beating metropolises.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon is unlikely to slip back into the dismal state it was in before the mid-1980s. It is likely to remain richer and more productive than the rest of Britain. It will remain Europe’s most powerful magnet for talented immigrants. Still, its pulling power is likely to wane. If that happens, Britain’s economy will probably suffer. But a less centralised country, in which opportunity was more evenly distributed, might be a better place in other ways.\n<span>\n■\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\nEditor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of\n</em>\nThe Economist Today\n<em>\n, our daily\n<a href="https://my.economist.com/user#newsletter">\nnewsletter\n</a>\n.
