Biden Jr.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Amash, a former Republican who\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/04/us/politics/justin-amash-trump.html">\nleft the party last year\n</a>\nafter clashing with Mr. Trump and later voted to impeach him, explained on Twitter that he believed there were probably insurmountable hurdles to running a successful candidacy this year from outside the two major political parties.\n</p>\n<p>\nAmong those challenges, he said, is the difficulty of campaigning and qualifying for the ballot in all 50 states during a pandemic that has brought much of the country’s public life to a halt. He added that it would be difficult to raise money in the middle of a severe economic downturn.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I continue to believe that a candidate from outside the old parties, offering a vision of government grounded in liberty and equality, can break through in the right environment,” Mr. Amash said. “But this environment presents extraordinary challenges.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Amash, a 40-year-old conservative of Syrian-American descent, stirred anxiety across the political spectrum last month when he declared that he was formally joining the Libertarian Party\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/politics/justin-amash-president.html">\nto consider a campaign\n</a>\nfor its 2020 presidential nomination. Republicans feared that he could peel away votes from Mr. Trump on the right, while Democrats worried that he would attract disillusioned Republican voters who might otherwise embrace Mr. Biden as the only available alternative to Mr. Trump.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt has been decades since a candidate who is neither a Republican nor a Democrat has become a major competitor for the presidency, but minor candidates have repeatedly peeled away support from the two traditional parties in disruptive ways. Mr. Amash could well have played that kind of role, especially in\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/us/politics/justin-amash-president-trump.html">\nhis home state Michigan\n</a>\n, a state Mr. Trump carried in 2016 but where he is currently trailing Mr. Biden in the polls.\n</p>\n<p>\nA poll taken this month by Monmouth University suggested Mr. Amash could have started a presidential candidacy that made a small but not insignificant imprint on the campaign. In a two-way race between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, the poll showed Mr. Biden ahead by 9 percentage points. With Mr. Amash included, Mr. Biden led by a slightly smaller margin of 7 percentage points.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the poll, about four in five voters said they had no opinion of Mr. Amash.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn Saturday, Mr. Amash acknowledged that “polarization is near an all-time high,” leaving even less room than usual for options outside the traditional party system.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Amash said he would remain supportive of the Libertarian Party, though his exit from the presidential contest left the group without any White House contenders of even modest political stature. The small-government group welcomed Mr. Amash with open arms in April, when he became the only member of Congress to have ever been a member of the party.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the past few elections, the Libertarians have nominated former Republican officeholders for the presidency. In 2016, a ticket composed of two former Republican governors, Gary Johnson of New Mexico and Bill Weld of Massachusetts, collected about four and a half million votes — a bit more than 3 percent of the popular vote.\n</p>\n</section>\n<div>\n<section>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>\nUpdated May 15, 2020\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<hr>\n<h2>\nThe Latest\n</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\nJoseph R.

Linick, who led the office of the inspector general at the State Department, citing a pattern of “politically-motivated firing of inspectors general.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Trump told Speaker Nancy Pelosi late Friday night that he was ousting Mr. Linick, who was named by President Barack Obama to the State Department post, and replacing him with an ambassador with close ties to Vice President Mike Pence in the latest purge of inspectors general whom Mr. Trump has deemed insufficiently loyal to his administration.\n</p>\n<p>\n<a title href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/8/d/8da0aa4f-a15c-4e06-95fd-fec3354349f6/405342547241548579C8FD9CE08E609F.5-16-2020.-ele-menendez-letter-to-wh-preservation-order.pdf">\nIn letters to the White House\n</a>\n,\n<a title href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/1/9/19dca9e5-3a85-495e-91b4-e756a923f844/6ED0F6C850ABADB4D3C353021AC2E819.5-16-2020.-ele-menendez-letter-to-biegun-preservation-order.pdf">\nState Department\n</a>\n, and\n<a title href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/e/4/e4cc407e-8cdf-4d54-8e5e-f6e6262e1eb5/98001CA54249C2DD155A93B746A1BD3F.5-16-2020.-ele-menendez-letter-to-state-oig-preservation-order.pdf">\nMr. Linick\n</a>\n, Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, requested that the administration turn over records and information related to the firing of Mr. Linick as well as “records of all I.G. investigations involving the Office of the Secretary that were open, pending, or incomplete at the time of Mr. Linick’s firing.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Engel and Mr. Menendez said in their letters that they believe Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recommended Mr. Linick’s ouster because he had opened an investigation into Mr. Pompeo’s conduct. The lawmakers did not provide any more details, but a Democratic aide said that Mr. Linick had been looking into whether Mr. Pompeo had misused a political appointee at the State Department to perform personal tasks for himself and his wife.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Such an action, transparently designed to protect Secretary Pompeo from personal accountability, would undermine the foundation of our democratic institutions and may be an illegal act of retaliation,” the lawmakers wrote.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnder law, the administration must notify Congress 30 days before formally terminating an inspector general. Mr. Linick is expected to leave his post then.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Trump’s decision to remove Mr. Linick is the latest in a series of ousters aimed at inspectors general who the president and his allies believe are opposed to his agenda.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn May, Mr. Trump moved to\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/us/politics/trump-health-department-watchdog.html">\noust Christi A.
