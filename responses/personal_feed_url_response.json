We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain.\n</div>\n<h3>\nMethods\n</h3>\n<div>\nWe did a dose-escalation, single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, phase 1 trial of an Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in Wuhan, China. Healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years were sequentially enrolled and allocated to one of three dose groups (5\u2008×\u200810\n<sup>\n10\n</sup>\n, 1\u2008×\u200810\n<sup>\n11\n</sup>\n, and 1·5\u2008×\u200810\n<sup>\n11\n</sup>\nviral particles) to receive an intramuscular injection of vaccine. The primary outcome was adverse events in the 7 days post-vaccination. Safety was assessed over 28 days post-vaccination. Specific antibodies were measured with ELISA, and the neutralising antibody responses induced by vaccination were detected with SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation and pseudovirus neutralisation tests. T-cell responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot and flow-cytometry assays. This study is registered with\n<a href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">\nClinicalTrials.gov\n</a>\n,\n<a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04313127">\nNCT04313127\n</a>\n.\n</div>\n<h3>\nFindings\n</h3>\n<div>\nBetween March 16 and March 27, 2020, we screened 195 individuals for eligibility. Of them, 108 participants (51% male, 49% female; mean age 36·3 years) were recruited and received the low dose (n=36), middle dose (n=36), or high dose (n=36) of the vaccine. All enrolled participants were included in the analysis. At least one adverse reaction within the first 7 days after the vaccination was reported in 30 (83%) participants in the low dose group, 30 (83%) participants in the middle dose group, and 27 (75%) participants in the high dose group. The most common injection site adverse reaction was pain, which was reported in 58 (54%) vaccine recipients, and the most commonly reported systematic adverse reactions were fever (50 [46%]), fatigue (47 [44%]), headache (42 [39%]), and muscle pain (18 [17%]. Most adverse reactions that were reported in all dose groups were mild or moderate in severity. No serious adverse event was noted within 28 days post-vaccination. ELISA antibodies and neutralising antibodies increased significantly at day 14, and peaked 28 days post-vaccination. Specific T-cell response peaked at day 14 post-vaccination.\n</div>\n<h3>\nInterpretation\n</h3>\n<div>\nThe Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine is tolerable and immunogenic at 28 days post-vaccination. Humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 peaked at day 28 post-vaccination in healthy adults, and rapid specific T-cell responses were noted from day 14 post-vaccination. Our findings suggest that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine warrants further investigation.\n</div>\n<h3>\nFunding\n</h3>\n<div>\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China, National Science and Technology Major Project, and CanSino Biologics.\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section data-locator="cesec10">\n<h2>\n<span>\nIntroduction\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div>\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in January, 2020.

We also searched the\n<a href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">\nClinicalTrials.gov\n</a>\nregistry for unpublished trials of COVID-19 vaccines, up to May 6, 2020. In addition to the adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine reported here, seven candidate COVID-19 vaccines are in ongoing clinical trials, including Moderna\'s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, Inovio Pharmaceuticals\' DNA vaccine, Sinovac, Wuhan and Beijing Institute of Biological Products\' inactive COVID-19 vaccines, University of Oxford\'s chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, and BioNTech\'s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.\n</div>\n<strong>\nAdded value of this study\n</strong>\n<div>\nThis first-in-human trial showed that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was tolerable and immunogenic in healthy adults. One dose of the vaccine at all dose concentrations (5\u2008×\u200810\n<sup>\n10\n</sup>\n, 1\u2008×\u200810\n<sup>\n11\n</sup>\n, and 1·5\u2008×\u200810\n<sup>\n11\n</sup>\nviral particles) tested induced both specific antibody and T-cell responses in most participants. Rapid specific T-cell responses were noted at day 14 and specific humoral responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 peaked at day 28 post-vaccination. Although we found that the high dose vaccine tended to be more immunogenic than the middle dose and low dose vaccines, it was also associated with a higher reactogenicity. Severe fever, fatigue, dyspnoea, muscle pain, and joint pain were reported in some of the recipients in the high dose group.\n</div>\n<strong>\nImplications of all the available evidence\n</strong>\n<div>\nMany vaccine candidates are in rapid development, including recombinant-protein based vaccines, replicating or non-replicating viral vector-based vaccines, DNA vaccines, and mRNA vaccines (which mostly have focused on the spike glycoprotein or receptor binding domain), live attenuated vaccines, and inactivated virus vaccines. All of these vaccine platforms have advantages and disadvantages, and it is too soon to predict which will be more successful. Our study suggests that there is potential for further investigation of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine for prevention of COVID-19.\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\nHere, we report the preliminary assessment at 28 days post-vaccination of the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of CanSino\'s non-replicating Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in healthy adults in China.\n</div>\n</section>\n<section data-locator="cesec20">\n<h2>\n<span>\nMethod\n</span>\n</h2>\n<section data-locator="cesec30">\n<h3>\n<span>\nStudy design and participants\n</span>\n</h3>\n<div>\nWe did a single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, dose-escalation phase 1 trial of an Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidate in a rehabilitation centre in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.

The vaccine is a replication defective Ad5 vectored vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. We cloned an optimised full-length spike gene based on Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession number YP_009724390) with the tissue plasminogen activator signal peptide gene into an E1 and E3 deleted Ad5 vector, and constructed the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine using the Admax system from Microbix Biosystem (Toronto, ON, Canada). The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was manufactured as a liquid formulation containing 5\u2008×\u200810\n<sup>\n10\n</sup>\nviral particles per 0·5 mL in a vial.\n</div>\n<div>\nA single shot was allocated intramuscularly in the arm of the participants in the low dose group, with one vial of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine (5\u2008×\u200810\n<sup>\n10\n</sup>\nviral particles per 0·5 mL). The participants in the middle dose group received one shot intramuscularly in the arm with two vials of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine (1\u2008×\u200810\n<sup>\n11\n</sup>\nviral particles per mL). Participants in the high dose group received a double-shot regimen with one vial of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in one arm and two vials of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in the other arm (1·5\u2008×\u200810\n<sup>\n11\n</sup>\nviral particles per 1·5 mL).\n</div>\n<div>\nAdverse events were self-reported by the participants, but verified by investigators daily during the first 14 days after vaccination. Subsequently, adverse events were recorded by the participants on diary cards in the following weeks. Laboratory safety tests including white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophils, platelets, haemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, fasting blood glucose, and creatinine were measured on day 7 to assess any toxic effects post-vaccination. We graded adverse events and abnormal changes in laboratory tests according to the scale issued by the China State Food and Drug Administration (version 2019).\n<sup>\n<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31208-3/fulltext#bib11">\n11\n</a>\n</sup>\n<span>\nNational Medical Products Administration\n</span>\n<a href="http://www.nmpa.gov.cn/WS04/CL2138/373037.html">\nhttp://www.nmpa.gov.cn/WS04/CL2138/373037.html\n</a>\n<div>\n<span>\nDate:\n</span>\n2019\n</div>\n<div>\n<span>\nDate accessed:\n</span>\nMay 20, 2020\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\nBlood samples were taken from participants for serology tests at the scheduled site visits before the vaccination, and on days 14 and 28 after the vaccination.

All measurements were subtracted from the unstimulated control values, and minus values were corrected to zero. The results were considered positive if there was at least a two-times increase in the number of IFNγ secreting T cells post-vaccination. We also assessed the CD4\n<sup>\n+\n</sup>\nand CD8\n<sup>\n+\n</sup>\nT-cell responses to vaccination according to the secretion of IFNγ, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), which were measured by intracellular cytokine staining assays in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after the stimulation with overlapping spike glycoprotein peptide pools for about 6 h and detected by flow cytometry. Similar methods to measure T-cell responses by intracellular cytokine staining assays have been reported previously.\n<sup>\n<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31208-3/fulltext">\n13\n</a>\n</sup>\n<ul title="list of authors">\n<li>\nEwer K\n</li>\n<li>\nRampling T\n</li>\n<li>\nVenkatraman N\n</li>\n<li>\net al.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\nA monovalent chimpanzee adenovirus Ebola vaccine boosted with MVA.\n<div>\n<i>\nN Engl J Med.\n</i>\n<span>\n2016;\n</span>\n<span>\n374\n</span>\n:\n<span>\n1635-1646\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<sup>\n,\n</sup>\n<sup>\n<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31208-3/fulltext">\n14\n</a>\n</sup>\n<div>\n<ul title="list of authors">\n<li>\nDe Santis O\n</li>\n<li>\nAudran R\n</li>\n<li>\nPothin E\n</li>\n<li>\net al.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\nSafety and immunogenicity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored Ebola vaccine in healthy adults: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding, phase 1/2a study.\n<div>\n<i>\nLancet Infect Dis.\n</i>\n<span>\n2016;\n</span>\n<span>\n16\n</span>\n:\n<span>\n311-320\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThe pre-vaccination and post-vaccination anti-Ad5 neutralising antibody titres were detected with a serum neutralisation assay.\n<sup>\n<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31208-3/fulltext#bib15">\n15\n</a>\n</sup>\n<div>\n<ul title="list of authors">\n<li>\nSprangers MC\n</li>\n<li>\nLakhai W\n</li>\n<li>\nKoudstaal W\n</li>\n<li>\net al.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\nQuantifying adenovirus-neutralizing antibodies by luciferase transgene detection: addressing preexisting immunity to vaccine and gene therapy vectors.\n<div>\n<i>\nJ Clin Microbiol.\n</i>\n<span>\n2003;\n</span>\n<span>\n41\n</span>\n:\n<span>\n5046-5052\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section data-locator="cesec50">\n<h3>\n<span>\nOutcomes\n</span>\n</h3>\n<div>\nWe analysed all outcomes in the intention-to-treat cohort. The primary endpoint for safety was the occurrence of adverse reactions within 7 days after the vaccination. Any abnormal changes in laboratory measures at 7 days post-vaccination, and adverse events within 28 days across the treatment groups were also analysed as secondary safety endpoints. The specific ELISA antibody titres to RBD and the spike glycoprotein, and the neutralising antibody amounts against live SARS-CoV-2 and a pseudovirus were measured as humoral immunogenicity endpoints. We defined a positive antibody response (seroconversion) as at least a four-fold increase in post-vaccination titre from baseline. ELISpot IFNγ and positive T-cell responses measured by intracellular cytokine staining assays were compared across the groups as endpoints for cell-mediated responses. Stratified analyses of the immune responses were done based on the pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody titres among the participants as low or negative (≤1:200) or high (>1:200).\n</div>\n</section>\n<section data-locator="cesec60">\n<h3>\n<span>\nStatistical analysis\n</span>\n</h3>\n<div>\nThe sample size was not determined on the basis of statistical power calculations; however, a minimum sample size of 20–30 participants for a pilot vaccine trial has been recommended by the National Medical Products Administration, China. We assessed the number and proportion of participants with adverse reactions post-vaccination and compared safety profiles across the dose groups. The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were presented as geometric mean titres with 95% CIs and the cellular responses were shown as a proportion of positive responders. We used the χ\n<sup>\n2\n</sup>\ntest or Fisher\'s exact test to analyse categorical data, ANOVA to analyse the log transformed antibody titres, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for data that were not normally distributed. When the overall difference across the three groups was significant, pairwise comparisons were made and the differences between groups were estimated with 95% CIs. Multivariable analysis was used to establish the possible effects on the immunogenicity and safety profile of the vaccine candidates. Hypothesis testing was two-sided with an α value of 0·05. Statistical analyses were done by a statistician using SAS (version 9.4) or GraphPad Prism 8·0·1. SPICE (version 6.0) was used for the analysis of data from multicolour flow cytometry experiments.\n</div>\n<div>\nAn independent data and safety monitoring committee, with one independent statistician, one clinician, and one epidemiologist, was established before the start of the trial. Safety data for the first 3 days post-vaccination were assessed and reviewed by the committee to ensure that there was sufficient holding time between dose escalation.

No significant difference in the overall number of adverse reactions across the treatment groups was observed. The most common injection site adverse reaction was pain, which was reported in 58 (54%) vaccine recipients. Pain was reported in 17 (47%) participants in the low dose group, 20 (56%) participants in the middle dose group, and 21 (58%) participants in the high dose group. The most commonly reported systematic adverse reactions overall were fever (50 [46%]), fatigue (47 [44%]), headache (42 [39%]), and muscle pain (18 [17%]). Fever was reported in 15 (42%) participants in the low dose group, 15 (42%) participants in the middle dose group, and 20 (56%) participants in the high dose group. Headache was reported in 14 (39%) participants in the low dose group, 11 (31%) participants in the middle dose group, and 17 (47%) participants in the high dose group. Muscle pain was reported in seven (19%) participants in the low dose group, three (8%) participants in the middle dose group, and eight (22%) participants in the high dose group. Most adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. Nine participants (two [6%] in the low dose group, two [6%] in the middle dose group, and five [14%] in the high dose group) had an episode of severe fever (grade 3) with axillary temperature greater than 38·5°C.

The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was tolerated in healthy adults in all three dose groups. The most common adverse reactions were fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain with no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions across the groups. Most adverse events reported were mild or moderate in severity. We noticed a higher reactogenicity profile of the high dose at 1·5\u2008×\u200810\n<sup>\n11\n</sup>\nviral particles, presenting as severe fever, fatigue, muscle pain, or joint pain, which might be associated with viraemia caused by Ad5 vector infection. However, the severe adverse reactions were transient and self-limiting. Additionally, no abnormal changes in laboratory measurements were clinically significant or considered to be related to the vaccine. The profile of adverse events reported in this trial is similar to that of another Ad5 vector-based Ebola vaccine expressing glycoprotein.\n<sup>\n<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31208-3/fulltext#bib16">\n16\n</a>\n</sup>\n<div>\n<ul title="list of authors">\n<li>\nZhu FC\n</li>\n<li>\nHou LH\n</li>\n<li>\nLi JX\n</li>\n<li>\net al.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\nSafety and immunogenicity of a novel recombinant adenovirus type-5 vector-based Ebola vaccine in healthy adults in China: preliminary report of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial.\n<div>\n<i>\nLancet.\n</i>\n<span>\n2015;\n</span>\n<span>\n385\n</span>\n:\n<span>\n2272-2279\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\nTo accelerate the process of clinical evaluation of the candidate COVID-19 vaccine, we selected doses for the phase 2 study mainly on the basis of the safety profile of the candidate vaccines shown in the participants within 7 days and 14 days post-vaccination. We chose the low dose (5\u2008×\u200810\n<sup>\n10\n</sup>\nviral particles) and middle dose (1\u2008×\u200810\n<sup>\n11\n</sup>\nviral particles) to be further assessed in a phase 2 clinical trial.\n</div>\n<div>\nThe Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was immunogenic, inducing humoral and T-cell responses rapidly in most participants. Onset of detectable immune responses was rapid, with T-cell responses peaking at day 14 after vaccination and antibodies peaking at day 28. The antibody response to the vaccine in the high dose group was slightly greater than that in the middle dose and low dose groups. A single dose of Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was able to elicit a four-fold increase in binding antibodies to RBD in 94–100% of participants, and a four-fold increase to live virus in 50–75% of participants. Despite differences in magnitudes of the antibodies measured through different methods, there was a strong positive correlation between binding antibodies and neutralising antibody titres to the live virus. High proportions of participants with positive T-cell responses were noted across the all dose groups post-vaccination. The activation of both CD4\n<sup>\n+\n</sup>\nT cells and CD8\n<sup>\n+\n</sup>\nT cells was observed in vaccine recipients, particularly for antigen-specific CD4\n<sup>\n+\n</sup>\nT cells and CD8\n<sup>\n+\n</sup>\nT cells. However, both the specific antibody response and T-cell response induced by vaccination were partly diminished by the presence of high pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity.\n</div>\n<div>\nCurrently, correlates of protection for a vaccine against COVID-19 are unknown, and the roles of the specific antibodies or T cells in building effective protection are not yet defined. Therefore, we are unable to predict the protection of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine on the basis of the vaccine-elicited immune responses in this study. However, previous studies investigating SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) found that the increases in specific antibodies were temporary, and declined quickly in patients after recovery, whereas the specific CD4\n<sup>\n+\n</sup>\nand CD8\n<sup>\n+\n</sup>\nT-cell responses played an essential role in immunity.\n<sup>\n<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31208-3/fulltext">\n17\n</a>\n</sup>\n<div>\n<ul title="list of authors">\n<li>\nZhao J\n</li>\n<li>\nZhao J\n</li>\n<li>\nPerlman S\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\nT cell responses are required for protection from clinical disease and for virus clearance in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-infected mice.\n<div>\n<i>\nJ Virol.\n</i>\n<span>\n2010;\n</span>\n<span>\n84\n</span>\n:\n<span>\n9318-9325\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<sup>\n,\n</sup>\n<sup>\n<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31208-3/fulltext">\n18\n</a>\n</sup>\n<div>\n<ul title="list of authors">\n<li>\nChannappanavar R\n</li>\n<li>\nFett C\n</li>\n<li>\nZhao J\n</li>\n<li>\nMeyerholz DK\n</li>\n<li>\nPerlman S\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\nVirus-specific memory CD8 T cells provide substantial protection from lethal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection.\n<div>\n<i>\nJ Virol.\n</i>\n<span>\n2014;\n</span>\n<span>\n88\n</span>\n:\n<span>\n11034-11044\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\nA similar rapid decline of the specific antibody amounts in patients with COVID-19 after recovery was also noted,\n<sup>\n<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31208-3/fulltext">\n19\n</a>\n</sup>\n<ul title="list of authors">\n<li>\nWang X\n</li>\n<li>\nGuo X\n</li>\n<li>\nXin Q\n</li>\n<li>\net al.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\nNeutralizing antibodies responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 inpatients and convalescent patients.\n<span>\n<i>\nmedRxiv.\n</i>\n<span>\n2020;\n</span>\n(\n<span>\nDOI: 2020.04.15.20065623 (preprint)\n</span>\n)\n</span>\n</div>\n<sup>\n,\n</sup>\n<sup>\n<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31208-3/fulltext">\n20\n</a>\n</sup>\n<ul title="list of authors">\n<li>\nWu F\n</li>\n<li>\nWang A\n</li>\n<li>\nLiu M\n</li>\n<li>\net al.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\nNeutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a COVID-19 recovered patient cohort and their implications.\n<span>\n<i>\nmedRxiv.\n</i>\n<span>\n2020;\n</span>\n(\n<span>\nDOI: 2020.03.30.20047365 (preprint)\n</span>\n)\n</span>\n</div>\nsuggesting that both specific cellular and humoral immunity are potentially important for a successful COVID-19 vaccine.

Therefore, we did serological screening, nucleic acid testing, and chest CT to exclude participants who had been previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during recruitment. In addition, we arranged for all participants in our study to stay in a designated hotel for 14 days post-vaccination. This arrangement facilitated the observation of adverse events after the immunisation of the participants, and reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the following 2 weeks. These measures allowed the study to be done successfully without interference by the circulation of SARS-CoV-2, which is especially important in the absence of a placebo control.\n</div>\n<div>\nInterpretation of the results of this study is limited by the small size of the cohort, the short duration of follow-up, and the absence of a randomised control group. As it was a first-in-human study of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine, it was not designed to measure the vaccine efficacy. However, in preclinical studies, seven out of eight ferrets were protected from having detectable virus copies when challenged by SARS-CoV-2 through nasal dripping 21 days after immunisation with the vaccine, whereas only one out of eight ferrets in the control group was negative for virus copies (Wei C, unpublished). We aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the candidate vaccine in healthy adults, with no interference by underlying diseases or medicines. However, results of our study indicated that older age could have a negative effect on the vaccine-elicited responses to SARS-CoV-2. In this trial, no participants were older than 60 years and only 16% of the participants were older than 50 years, providing limited information on the capability of generating a potent cellular and humoral response in the older population. Since age has also been identified as an independent risk factor for severe disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection,\n<sup>\n<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31208-3/fulltext">\n4\n</a>\n</sup>\n<ul title="list of authors">\n<li>\nWeiss P\n</li>\n<li>\nMurdoch DR\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\nClinical course and mortality risk of severe COVID-19.\n<div>\n<i>\nLancet.\n</i>\n<span>\n2020;\n</span>\n<span>\n395\n</span>\n:\n<span>\n1014-1015\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<sup>\n,\n</sup>\n<sup>\n<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31208-3/fulltext">\n22\n</a>\n</sup>\n<ul title="list of authors">\n<li>\nYe G\n</li>\n<li>\nPan Z\n</li>\n<li>\nPan Y\n</li>\n<li>\net al.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\nClinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reactivation.\n<div>\n<i>\nJ Infect.\n</i>\n<span>\n2020;\n</span>\n<span>\n80\n</span>\n:\n<span>\ne14-e17\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\nand there is a possibility that an even lower immune response might be found in the older population, we are going to include participants who are older than 60 years in the phase 2 study considering this population as an important target population for a COVID-19 vaccine.

Lots of it, smothered in strawberries and cream.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nMy recipe is a classic yellow cake that’s whisked in one bowl. It is slightly fussier than other one-bowl cakes in that you’ll definitely need that whisk, and a dedication to some brief but furious mixing. But the result is a cake that’s fantastically silky, tender and buttery without being at all heavy — and without calling for an electric mixer.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nTo make it, take 3 eggs out of the fridge and let them come to room temperature. Or put them in a bowl of hot water for 15 minutes. They shouldn’t be cold, or they won’t whisk up nicely. While you’re at it, melt 4 tablespoons/60 grams unsalted butter, and let it cool. Heat the oven to 350 degrees.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nCrack the eggs into a large bowl, add 1 ¼ cups/250 grams granulated sugar, and whisk the heck out of it. I whisked for exactly one energetic, bicep-tingling minute. You want the mixture to be frothy and bubbly, but you don’t need it to look like mousse, or to “ribbon” on itself — it just has to inflate slightly. This helps give you a nice, light crumb.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhisk in the butter, ½ cup/120 milliliters flavorless oil — I used sunflower, but use whatever you have, even mild olive oil, works — and 1 cup/240 milliliters buttermilk or a combination of yogurt or sour cream thinned with some milk. Add flavorings: citrus zest, orange or lemon extract, vanilla extract, almond extract, a shot of bourbon. I used both vanilla and almond extracts just to see what would happen. Good things, try it!\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nNow whisk in ½ teaspoon each salt and baking soda, and 2 teaspoons baking powder. Finally, whisk in 2 cups/255 grams all-purpose or cake flour. (I used all-purpose from the quickly diminishing 50-pound sack I started this pandemic with.) Whisk vigorously for another 30 seconds to eliminate any lumps.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nThen, pour the batter into greased and parchment-lined pans (or greased and floured). You can use two 8-inch layer cake pans (bake for 30 to 35 minutes); a 9x13-inch pan (25 to 35 minutes); or 24 cupcake molds (use liners, and bake for 17 to 22 minutes). The batter rises a lot, so don’t worry if it doesn’t look as though there’s enough. You’ll know the cake is done when it’s golden and the top springs back when lightly pressed in the center.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nOnce cooled, you can frost it as you like. I went for whipped cream and strawberries. But chocolate frosting or a satiny buttercream would make it birthday party worthy. It’s perfect for whatever you’re celebrating, even if that’s just taking a moment to enjoy a slice of cake.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n<em>\nThis is part of a series in which Melissa Clark teaches you how to

Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced a torrent of calls on Saturday to dismiss his most influential adviser, Dominic Cummings, after reports that Mr. Cummings had visited relatives in northern England while he was ill with the coronavirus — a violation of Britain’s lockdown rules.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Johnson appeared determined to stand by Mr. Cummings, an enigmatic figure who helped mastermind his election victory last year and the Brexit campaign that resulted in Britain’s departure from the European Union.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the reports that Mr. Cummings had driven to his parents’ house in Durham in April when the government was urging people to stay home — particularly those with symptoms of the virus — set off a political tempest, with critics accusing him of flouting the rules that apply to everybody else.\n</p>\n<p>\n“The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings,” said a spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, who added that he had “breached the lockdown rules.”\n</p>\n<p>\nLeaders of two other opposition parties, the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party, demanded that he resign or be fired.\n</p>\n<p>\nConfronted by reporters outside his home on Saturday, Mr. Cummings said, “I behaved reasonably and legally.” Asked whether his decision had been “a good look,” he replied: “Who cares about good looks? It’s a question of doing the right thing. It is not about what you guys think.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe furious reactions to his trip attested to the polarizing role Mr. Cummings has played in British politics since before the 2016 Brexit referendum. He has accumulated a long list of enemies, including some in the Conservative Party, like Iain Duncan Smith, a former party leader, whom he has ridiculed or sidelined.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut it also showed Mr. Johnson’s deep reliance on Mr. Cummings. The prime minister dug in his heels on Saturday, releasing a statement, through a spokesman, that defended Mr. Cummings and his wife for making the 260-mile drive to Durham. It said they had been trying to line up care for their young child after he contracted the virus and expected he would fall ill.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/23/world/23UK-CUMMINGS02/merlin_172377804_dfc3afa5-25ca-4934-acdb-449c44a60a3e-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain in London this month.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I protect myself while flying?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf air travel is unavoidable,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html">\nthere are some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n</a>\nMost important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html">\nnew concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms\n</a>\n. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I get tested?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nthe C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears.\n</a>\nThey will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I help?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=7779">\nCharity Navigator\n</a>\n, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak.

But the Labour Party said that Downing Street’s explanations “raised more questions than they answer” and called for an inquiry into Mr. Cummings’s actions.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile the Labour Party demanded answers, it stopped short of demanding his resignation. That appeared to reflect a tactical judgment by the party leader, Keir Starmer, that the episode would do more damage to the government, which is already on the defensive for its handling of the virus, if it were dragged out over several days.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nAnd criticism flowed not just from opposition politicians.\n</p>\n<p>\nJulia Hartley-Brewer, a broadcaster and journalist who generally leans to the right politically, described how she had been separated from her 77-year-old mother, who lives on her own and suffered a heart attack in December.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n“So excuse me if I am beyond bloody incandescent at what Dominic Cummings did,”\n<a title href="https://twitter.com/JuliaHB1/status/1263939337030438917">\nshe wrote in a tweet that used another expletive.\n</a>\n</p>\n</section>\n<p>\nAdvertisement\n</p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/world/europe/dominic-cummings-lockdown.html#after-bottom">\nContinue reading the main story\n</a>\n</article>', 'direction': 'ltr'}, 'title': 'Outrage Grows Over Boris Johnson Aide’s 260-Mile Trip During Lockdown', 'author': 'Mark Landler and Stephen Castle', 'summary': {'content': 'Dominic Cummings, the British prime minister’s top adviser, said he behaved “reasonably and legally” in driving for child care needs while coming down with the coronavirus.', 'direction': 'ltr'}, 'enclosure': [{'href': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/23/world/23UK-CUMMINGS01/23UK-CUMMINGS01-moth.jpg', 'width': 151, 'height': 151}], 'alternate': [{'href': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/world/europe/dominic-cummings-lockdown.html', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'crawled': 1590252045387, 'published': 1590250640000, 'origin': {'streamId': 'feed/http://morss.it/rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml', 'title': 'NYT > Top Stories', 'htmlUrl': 'https://www.nytimes.com'}, 'unread': True, 'categories': [{'id': 'user/ede62ec0-5773-49b1-bfe7-c2843e0f4dec/category/News', 'label': 'News'}]}, {'id': 'LC+tTeGd/hL8eEP7xJuq4oS1fAqpoaN6uiBKAKBy1+A=_1724268844b:26ddc12:ff496e89', 'keywords': ['Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)', 'Moderna Inc', 'Gilead Sciences Inc', 'Vaccination and Immunization', 'Remdesivir (Drug)', 'Science and Technology', 'Academic and Scientific Journals', 'Biotechnology and Bioengineering', 'Clinical Trials', 'bioRxiv', 'medRxiv', 'Stocks and Bonds', 'Research', 'News and News Media', 'your-feed-healthcare'], 'originId': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/health/coronavirus-vaccine-moderna.html', 'fingerprint': 'f71a157c', 'content': {'content': '<article>\n<section>\n</section>\n<p>\nAdvertisement\n</p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/health/coronavirus-vaccine-moderna.html#after-top">\nContinue reading the main story\n</a>\n<header>\n<p>\nSupported by\n</p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/health/coronavirus-vaccine-moderna.html#after-sponsor">\nContinue reading the main story\n</a>\n<h1>\nHow Upbeat Vaccine News Fueled a Stock Surge, and an Uproar\n</h1>\n<p>\nThe desperate hunt for treatments and vaccines has changed how researchers, regulators, drug companies like Moderna, investors and journalists do their jobs.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/science/24Virus-Moderna1/merlin_172613619_0a4239ac-6f3f-455d-a5d8-e24be60bd686-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nHours after announcing positive results from a small trial of its coronavirus vaccine, Moderna Therapeutics unveiled a stock offering that sought to raise $1.3 billion.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nBrian Snyder/Reuters\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nBy\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katie-thomas">\n<span>\nKatie Thomas\n</span>\n</a>\nand\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/denise-grady">\n<span>\nDenise Grady\n</span>\n</a>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<time>\nMay 23, 2020\n</time>\n<time>\nUpdated\n<span>\n12:00 p.m. ET\n</span>\n</time>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</header>\n<section name="articleBody">\n<div>\n<p>\nWhen the biotech company Moderna announced early on Monday morning positive results from a small, preliminary trial of its coronavirus vaccine, the company’s chief medical officer described the news as a “triumphant day for us.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nModerna’s stock price jumped as much as 30 percent. Its announcement helped lift the stock market and was widely reported by news organizations, including The New York Times.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nNine hours after its initial news release — and after the markets closed — the company announced a stock offering with the aim of raising more than $1 billion to help bankroll vaccine development. That offering had not been mentioned in Moderna’s briefings of investors and journalists that morning, and the company chairman later said it was decided on only that afternoon.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nBy Tuesday,\n<a title href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/19/moderna-carries-a-big-boy-market-valuation-now-so-it-shouldnt-act-like-a-biotech-penny-stock/">\na backlash\n</a>\nwas underway. The company had not released any more data, so scientists could not evaluate its claim. The government agency leading the trial, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had made no comment on the results. And the stock sale stirred concerns about whether the company\n<a title href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPgm1nfH1HQ">\nhad sought to jack up the price\n</a>\nof its stock offering with the news.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nThe Moderna episode is a case study in how the coronavirus pandemic and the desperate hunt for treatments and vaccines are shaking up the financial markets and the way that researchers, regulators, drug companies, biotech investors and journalists do their jobs.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nDrug companies accustomed to releasing early data to attract investors and satisfy regulators suddenly find themselves accused of revealing too much, or not enough, by a new, broader audience. Journalists may be scolded for hyping early findings, while those who ignore sketchy data may be blamed for missing the news.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nScientists who take the traditional time to gather and analyze their data for publication in mainstream journals are criticized for sitting on lifesaving information. Upstart websites beat the journals and break the usual rules by publishing unvetted studies, some of dubious quality. And President Trump uses his bully pulpit to promote unproven treatments.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\n“You have these wild swings, based on incomplete information,” said David Maris, managing director of Phalanx Investment Partners, and a longtime analyst covering the pharmaceutical industry. “It’s a crazy, speculative environment, because the pandemic has caused people to want to believe that there’s going to be a miracle cure in a miracle time frame.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nModerna’s chairman, Noubar Afeyan, defended the decision to open a stock sale hours after releasing limited data. He said the company’s board had been considering an offering before Monday’s announcement, but finalized the decision only late in the day.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n“It was based on our looking at the data and concluding that we needed to have our own resources going into develop this vaccine and not simply wait for government grants,” he said. Moderna has a deal\n<a title href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-award-us-government-agency-barda-483-million">\nto receive up to $483 million\n</a>\nfrom the U.S. government to pursue a vaccine.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nWhile corporations and scientists are under incredible pressure to develop a vaccine and raise money for research and manufacturing, vaccine companies are also vying for attention from investors amid a crowded field and are seeking to lift their stock prices in a global recession.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nNearly all are trying to compress the timetable for developing vaccines that normally takes years, sometimes decades, into a year or so — and still ensure that the vaccines will be safe and effective.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nAt the same time, a torrent of information is blasting from medical journals as well as company and university news releases. Articles are posted on so-called preprint websites of studies that have not been peer-reviewed by experts, unlike articles in mainstream medical and science journals.\n<a title href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">\nClinicaltrials.gov\n</a>\n, which lists medical studies, showed that 1,673 were underway for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, as of May 23.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nNews outlets are rushing to stay on top of new findings, and to feed a public hungry for any advances in potential treatments or vaccine candidates that hold promise against the highly infectious virus. Some news organizations would prefer to maintain traditional practice and ignore early results of medical studies, waiting for peer-reviewed data but they are also competing to report on the latest studies.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nStill, concerns arise routinely about the quality of rapidly posted data and the motivations behind announcements.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\n“Why does any company release early data?” Mr. Maris asked. “Clearly there is an appetite for it. People want to know that we are making progress. Having a vaccine is the clearest way to a full reopening and putting this behind us.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nModerna’s preliminary results were promising. Its vaccine, the first to be tested in humans, appeared safe and stimulated antibody production in the first 45 study participants. And of eight who have undergone further testing so far, all produced so-called neutralizing antibodies, which can stop the virus from invading cells, and should prevent illness.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nBut there were no details — no charts, no graphs, no numbers, nothing published in a journal.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/science/24Virus-Moderna2/22VIRUS-UPROAR2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale">\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nDr. Anthony Fauci said that while companies often release partial data, his preference was “to wait until we get the data solid and then publish it.”\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nDoug Mills/The New York Times\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div>\n<p>\nReleasing sparse data is not unusual in the biotech world, where companies often present early trial results months before they are published in journals. Publicly traded companies are required to disclose material information that might lead an investor to buy or sell shares. The company said federal researchers who are conducting the trial would be responsible for submitting the data to be reviewed and published.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nMr. Maris said that he would leave it to regulators to decide if the company had acted inappropriately in not announcing the stock sale sooner, and said that investors should have been told earlier that the company was considering a stock offering. “There’s something wrong with that,” he said.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nModerna, based in Cambridge, Mass., went public in 2018 and has been a favorite of biotech investors, given its focus on the hot area of immuno-oncology and its partnerships with companies like Merck and AstraZeneca, and with the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<section>\n</section>\n</div>\n<p>\nIts technology, based on genetic material called messenger RNA or mRNA, is considered highly promising.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\n“Messenger RNA is one of the hot new platforms,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the infectious disease institute, said in an interview on Thursday, adding that it can be adapted quickly to produce new vaccines and scaled up easily.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nAlthough Moderna has other vaccines in its pipeline, none have come to market, and the viability of its mRNA vaccine-making platform — the basis of the company — is on the line. It is a front-runner in the coronavirus vaccine race, and its stock has risen more than 250 percent since the beginning of the year. It closed at $69 a share on Friday afternoon, down 26 percent from a high Monday of $87.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nDr. Afeyan acknowledged that companies were now subject to far more intense scrutiny with so much riding on the outcome of drug development.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nDr. Noubar Afeyan, Moderna’s chairman and co-founder, said that with so many different interests demanding the latest information, the company couldn’t withhold it from the public.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nVictor Boyko/Getty Images\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div>\n<p>\n“People are basically saying, you know, one shouldn’t do this,” Dr. Afeyan said. “And if you don’t put out data, people will say, why are you withholding the data? People are trading without knowing the data. So it’s a tough situation to be doing science in, and we have no choice because we’re trying to develop a vaccine.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nWith so many different interests demanding the latest information — including governments around the world — the company couldn’t withhold it from the public, he said. “As a public company, if we have it, we cannot give this to them and hide it from other people.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nDr. Fauci said that while companies often release partial data, “My own preference, and what my group will do, will be to wait until we get the data solid and then publish it in a paper saying, ‘In the first phase this is what we saw.’”\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nStill, he considers Moderna’s preliminary results encouraging. The levels of neutralizing antibodies in the eight people tested for them appeared high enough to be protective, Dr. Fauci said. But he emphasized that eight is a small number.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n“I have to underscore it’s still limited,” he said, “and that’s the reason why I just withhold my enthusiasm, but I still have some cautious optimism.”\n</p>\n<section>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2>\nFrequently Asked Questions and Advice\n</h2>\n<p>\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nCommon symptoms\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html">\ninclude fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.\n</a>\nSome of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html">\nThe C.D.C. has also\n</a>\nadded chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">\ndata from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed\n</a>\n, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I protect myself while flying?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf air travel is unavoidable,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html">\nthere are some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n</a>\nMost important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A\n<a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">\nstudy from Emory University\n</a>\nfound that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nIs ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThere is an uptick in\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">\npeople reporting symptoms of chilblains,\n</a>\nwhich are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">\nsymptom\n</a>\nof infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nCan I go to the park?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">\nEven if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I take my temperature?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nTaking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">\nother ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nShould I wear a mask?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nThe C.D.C. has\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">\nrecommended\n</a>\nthat all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html">\nnew concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms\n</a>\n. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nIf you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,\n</a>\nand have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow do I get tested?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\nIf you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus,\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">\nthe C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears.\n</a>\nThey will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>\n<strong>\nHow can I help?\n</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=7779">\nCharity Navigator\n</a>\n, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak.

Little has been known about another closely watched product, remdesivir, an experimental treatment for Covid-19 developed by the drugmaker Gilead.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nOn April 29,\n<a title href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/health/gilead-remdesivir-coronavirus.html">\nGilead announced that it was “aware of positive data”\n</a>\nabout remdesivir’s performance in a federal trial. A few hours later, from the Oval Office, Dr. Fauci said the drug could modestly speed recovery in patients. Although he said it was not a “knockout,” Dr. Fauci — his agency ran that trial, too — said the drug could become the standard of care.\n</p>\n<p>\nA few days afterward, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency authorization to use remdesivir to treat Covid-19.\n</p>\n<p>\nWeeks passed with no detailed data about the clinical trial being published, even though doctors were administering the drug with little information to guide them.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\n“It was a highly conflicted statement from a highly respected and deservedly respected scientist,” said Gary Schwitzer, the publisher of HealthNewsReview.Org, a watchdog publication that argues for more accurate science journalism. “So it brings you back to, what do we believe? Whom do we believe?”\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nDr. Fauci said he and his research team decided to report some results when the study was stopped after an independent safety board found that the treated patients were recovering faster than those receiving placebos. For ethical reasons, all patients had to be offered the drug.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nThe information would likely have leaked out — especially given that,\n<a title href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/16/early-peek-at-data-on-gilead-coronavirus-drug-suggests-patients-are-responding-to-treatment/">\ntwo weeks earlier,\n</a>\ninformation from another remdesivir trial had been disclosed to the news site STAT, sending Gilead’s stock up.\n</p>\n<p>\nDr. Fauci announced that patients treated with remdesivir recovered in 11 days, compared with 15 days for those getting placebos.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That was all the data we had,” he said. The\n<a title href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007764">\nfull results were published\n</a>\non Friday in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<span>\nImage\n</span>\n<figcaption>\n<span>\nGilead Sciences has developed an experimental treatment for Covid-19, remdesivir.\n</span>\n<span>\nCredit...\n</span>\n<span>\nMike Blake/Reuters\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div>\n<p>\nThe fast pace of research has caught many news organizations off guard, prompting case-by-case discussions on tight deadlines to decide whether — and how — to cover scientific news even when the quality of studies wouldn’t normally meet their standards.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\nScientific articles normally take months to go through peer review. But now, many papers are being published on preprint servers, where scientists are posting research before it is accepted by a journal. The site\n<a title href="https://www.medrxiv.org/">\nmedRxiv\n</a>\n, which was founded last June, had 10 million views in April and has posted nearly 3,100 papers related to Covid-19 since January. A similar site, bioRxiv, has posted about 760 papers on the virus.\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>\n“People recognized that there was an urgent need to disseminate information,” said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist and health care researcher at Yale University, and a co-founder of medRxiv. which is pronounced “med archive.” “People recognized that even weeks matter in this moment when we don’t know very much.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nAsked about criticism that sites like medRxiv encourage the rash publication of bad science, Dr. Krumholz said these conversations were healthy and noted that articles in peer-reviewed journals could also be flawed. Submissions go through basic vetting to ensure the research is legitimate.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n“Engage in whether it’s good science or not,” he said. “Let’s engage in the consequences of this.”\n</p>\n</section>\n<p>\nAdvertisement\n</p>\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/health/coronavirus-vaccine-moderna.html#after-bottom">\nContinue reading the main story\n</a>\n</article>', 'direction': 'ltr'}, 'title': 'How Upbeat Vaccine News Fueled a Stock Surge, and an Uproar', 'author': 'Katie Thomas and Denise Grady', 'summary': {'content': 'The desperate hunt for treatments and vaccines has changed how researchers, regulators, drug companies like Moderna, investors and journalists do their jobs.', 'direction': 'ltr'}, 'enclosure': [{'href': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/science/24Virus-Moderna1/22VIRUS-UPROAR1-moth.jpg', 'width': 151, 'height': 151}], 'alternate': [{'href': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/health/coronavirus-vaccine-moderna.html', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'crawled': 1590252045387, 'published': 1590249611000, 'origin': {'streamId': 'feed/http://morss.it/rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml', 'title': 'NYT > Top Stories', 'htmlUrl': 'https://www.nytimes.com'}, 'unread': True, 'categories': [{'id': 'user/ede62ec0-5773-49b1-bfe7-c2843e0f4dec/category/News', 'label': 'News'}]}, {'id': 'Mv/ZSFaK2g3sMbevU8eA1gDKPxcWlGA0Z5zuJKoJ6pU=_1724261978e:24ecddb:c60afd2c', 'keywords': ['Leandro Demori', 'Uncategorized'], 'originId': 'https://theintercept.com/?p=307839', 'fingerprint': '58a279c8', 'thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2020/05/15794819-txt-440x440.jpg'}], 'content': {'content': '<div>\n<img alt="15794819-txt" src="https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2020/05/15794819-txt.jpg" class="wp-image-307843">\n<p>Foto: Pedro Ladeira/Folhapress</p></div>\n<p><em>Este texto foi publicado originalmente na newsletter do Intercept Brasil.

Aceitou ser ministro de Bolsonaro porque se via maior que o presidente – e de fato era, em popularidade e aceitação entre a classe média que se mantém minimamente longe da psicopatia. Moro, com a ideia de uma vaga no STF e a garantia de independência no ministério, levou toda a turma de Curitiba.

Gerou expectativa de delação premiada, disse que um vídeo confirmaria tudo. A imprensa cozinhou expectativas. E o vídeo não confirma muito. Na verdade, a sequência de frases dita por Bolosnaro durante a reunião o <a rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/demori/status/1263927836441706497" target="_blank">tira, por enquanto, das cordas</a>.

Eu não quero ser escravo nesse país. E acabar com essa porcaria que é Brasília. Isso daqui é um cancro de corrupção, de privilégio.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>– Ela foi dita por Abraham Weintraub.</p>\n<p>E que tal essa?</p>\n<blockquote><p>“São pessoas aqui em Brasília, dos três poderes, que não sabem o que é povo. Eu converso com alguns, não sabe o que é o feijão com arroz, não sabe o que é um supermercado. Esqueceu.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>– Ela foi dita por Jair Bolsonaro.</p>\n<p>E essa?</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Os nossos seringueiros são em números maiores do que a gente imagina no Brasil. Então, tudo que nós fomos construir, nós vamos ter que ver, ministro, a questão dos valores também.

Institucionalmente, esse vídeo derrubaria qualquer presidente. Dilma caiu por menos, Collor caiu por menos. Bolsonaro confessou até mesmo uma espécie de aparato paralelo de investigação.
